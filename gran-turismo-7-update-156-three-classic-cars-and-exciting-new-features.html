Polyphony Digital, the masterminds behind the Gran Turismo franchise, have once again demonstrated their commitment to keeping the game fresh and engaging, nearly three years after its initial release on March 4, 2022. This update, highlighted by a recent trailer from Insider-Gaming, brings a trio of classic cars, new gameplay features, and refined content that promise to enhance the experience for both casual players and dedicated gearheads.</p><br><br><p>Gran Turismo 7 has long been celebrated for its meticulous attention to detail, photorealistic graphics, and an ever-expanding roster of vehicles that span the history of automotive engineering. With Update 1.56, the game continues to build on its reputation as the premier driving simulator, offering players new ways to race, customize, and explore. The inclusion of three distinctive cars—the 2003 BMW Z4 3.0i, the 1962 Mercedes-Benz Unimog Type 411, and the 1988 Peugeot 205 GTI—headlines this update, accompanied by additional content such as new tracks, a refreshed Café menu, and an upgrade to the game’s AI system, Sophy. Let’s dive into what this update has in store and why it’s a significant moment for the Gran Turismo community.</p></div><p></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="" height="" width="" alt="" data-is-external-image="true"></figure><p><br><br></p><div class="section"><h2>The Stars of Update 1.56: Three Classic Cars</h2><br><p>The heart of Update 1.56 lies in its new vehicles, each bringing a unique flavor to the Gran Turismo 7 garage. These cars, revealed in Polyphony Digital’s latest trailer, are not just additions to the roster—they are celebrations of automotive heritage, each with its own story and personality. Here’s a closer look at the trio that players can now take to the virtual tracks.</p><br><br><h3>2003 BMW Z4 3.0i</h3><br><p>First up is the 2003 BMW Z4 3.0i, a convertible roadster that marked a bold new direction for BMW in the early 2000s. Designed under the controversial yet visionary guidance of Chris Bangle, the Z4’s sharp lines and aggressive stance made it a standout in its era. Powered by a 3.0-liter inline-six engine producing 225 horsepower, this rear-wheel-drive beauty offers a balance of performance and elegance that’s perfect for Gran Turismo’s diverse circuits. Available in the game’s Brand Central and Used Cars dealership for 60,000 credits, the Z4 3.0i is poised to appeal to players who enjoy precision handling and the thrill of open-top driving.</p><br><br><p>The Z4’s inclusion in Update 1.56 is a nod to its enduring popularity and its status as a modern classic. While it may not be the fire-breathing M Roadster variant, its smooth power delivery and tunable potential make it a versatile addition. Whether cruising through the game’s Scapes mode or tackling a high-speed race, the Z4 brings a touch of Bavarian sophistication to Gran Turismo 7.</p><br><br><h3>1962 Mercedes-Benz Unimog Type 411</h3><br><p>Perhaps the most surprising addition is the 1962 Mercedes-Benz Unimog Type 411, a multipurpose truck that defies the conventional expectations of a racing game. The Unimog—short for “Universal-Motor-Gerät” (universal motor device)—was originally conceived in the postwar years as a rugged, all-terrain vehicle for agricultural and industrial use. The Type 411, produced from 1956 to 1974, is a compact yet capable model, equipped with a modest 1.7-liter diesel engine outputting just 34 horsepower in its stock form.</p><br><br><p>Priced at 46,000 credits in the Legends Cars dealership, the Unimog Type 411 is the cheapest vehicle in that category, making it an accessible curiosity for players. Its towering stance and off-road prowess set it apart from the sleek sports cars that dominate Gran Turismo 7, and its 32 Performance Points (PP) rating marks it as the slowest vehicle in the game under the current calculation system. Yet, its charm lies in its versatility—players can customize it with engine swaps and suspension upgrades, potentially turning this lumbering giant into an unexpected contender on the track. The Unimog’s inclusion reflects Polyphony Digital’s willingness to push boundaries and celebrate the diversity of automotive history.</p><br><br><h3>1988 Peugeot 205 GTI</h3><br><p>Rounding out the trio is the 1988 Peugeot 205 GTI, a legendary hot hatch that defined an era of spirited driving. Known for its lightweight construction and agile handling, the 205 GTI became a cult favorite among enthusiasts in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The 1.9-liter inline-four engine delivers around 130 horsepower, modest by today’s standards but more than enough to make this front-wheel-drive icon a joy to fling around corners. Available in the Used Cars dealership for 61,600 credits, it’s the priciest of the new additions, reflecting its rising value in the real-world collector market.</p><br><br><p>The Peugeot 205 GTI’s inclusion complements its rally-bred sibling, the 205 Turbo 16 Evolution 2, already in the game. While the T16 is a fire-breathing Group B monster, the GTI offers a more approachable, street-focused experience that’s perfect for Gran Turismo’s European Sunday Cup events. Its feisty character and nimble chassis make it a fan favorite, and its arrival in Update 1.56 is sure to delight players who cherish the golden age of hot hatches.</p><br></div><br><br><div class="section"><br><h2>Beyond the Cars: New Features and Content</h2><br><p>Update 1.56 isn’t just about adding new vehicles—it’s a holistic enhancement of the Gran Turismo 7 experience. Polyphony Digital has packed this patch with additional content and refinements that deepen the game’s appeal. Here’s what else players can expect as of February 27, 2025.</p><br><br><h3>New World Circuit Events</h3><br><p>Three new races have been added to the World Circuits mode, each tailored to showcase the strengths of the new cars. The Red Bull Ring Short Track hosts the Sunday Cup Classic, a three-lap event featuring the Mercedes-Benz Unimog Type 411, offering a modest 25,000 credits reward. This short, technical layout is an unusual but fitting stage for the truck’s debut, emphasizing its unique handling over raw speed. Meanwhile, the Grand Valley South Reverse hosts the European Sunday Cup 400, a three-lap race with the Peugeot 205 GTI in the spotlight, paying out 35,000 credits. Finally, the Autodrome Lago Maggiore East welcomes the European FR Challenge 550, a five-lap event featuring the BMW Z4 3.0i, with a 40,000-credit prize.</p><br><br><p>These events provide fresh challenges and opportunities to earn credits, though their relatively low payouts suggest they’re aimed at mid-tier players rather than those chasing high-stakes rewards. The variety of tracks—from the tight twists of Red Bull Ring to the scenic sweeps of Grand Valley—ensures that each car gets a chance to shine in its own way.</p><br><br><h3>Café Expansion: Peugeot Menu</h3><br><p>The Café, Gran Turismo 7’s hub for collecting and learning about cars, receives a new addition with Extra Menu No. 44, focused on Peugeot. Available to players at Collector Level 36 and above, this menu tasks players with gathering three Peugeot vehicles: the newly added 205 GTI, the 205 Turbo 16 Evolution 2 (a Legends Cars vehicle), and the 908 HDi FAP race car, which costs a fixed 1,000,000 credits. Completing the collection rewards a Five-Star Roulette Ticket, though the total cost of acquiring these cars far outweighs the prize’s value—a common trait of Café challenges.</p><br><br><p>This Peugeot-themed menu celebrates the French automaker’s legacy, tying together its street, rally, and racing heritage. It’s a fitting tribute that encourages players to explore the brand’s contributions to automotive culture, with the 205 GTI serving as an accessible entry point.</p><br><br><h3>GT Sophy Upgrade</h3><br><p>For PlayStation 5 players, Update 1.56 brings an enhancement to Gran Turismo Sophy, the game’s advanced artificial intelligence designed to provide a human-like racing challenge. This update extends Sophy’s presence to two additional circuits: the full Autodromo Nazionale Monza layout, including its iconic first chicane, and Sardegna Road Track B. With Sophy now available on 19 of the game’s 39 circuit locations (one variant each), it’s steadily becoming a cornerstone of the PS5 experience, though it remains exclusive to that platform, leaving PS4 players out of the loop.</p><br><br><p>Sophy’s machine-learning capabilities allow it to adapt to player behavior, offering a dynamic and competitive opponent that elevates the racing experience. Its expansion to Monza and Sardegna adds variety to the AI races, challenging players on tracks known for their speed and technical demands.</p><br></div><br><br><div class="section"><br><h2>The Bigger Picture: Gran Turismo 7’s Evolution</h2><br><p>Update 1.56 arrives as Gran Turismo 7 approaches its third anniversary, a milestone that underscores Polyphony Digital’s ongoing dedication to the title. Since its launch, the game has received regular updates—19 as of this patch—each adding cars, tracks, and quality-of-life improvements. From the inaugural 1.13 update in April 2022, which introduced the Subaru BRZ and Spa’s 24h layout, to the ambitious Spec II (1.40) update in November 2023 with seven cars and the Lake Louise track, the game has evolved significantly beyond its initial 400+ car roster.</p><br><br><p>As of version 1.56, Gran Turismo 7 boasts 529 vehicles, including 526 standard models and three special editions. This growth reflects a strategy of blending mainstream appeal with niche surprises, as evidenced by the Unimog’s inclusion alongside more traditional choices like the Z4 and 205 GTI. The game’s physics engine, visual fidelity, and features like Scapes mode have also been refined over time, ensuring it remains a benchmark in the simulation genre.</p><br><br><p>The update’s timing—just ahead of the 2025 Gran Turismo World Series—hints at Polyphony’s intent to keep the community engaged. While the new cars may not be meta-defining racers, their addition enriches the game’s sandbox, encouraging experimentation and nostalgia-driven play. The Unimog, in particular, stands out as a bold choice, potentially paving the way for more unconventional vehicles in future updates.</p><br></div><br><br><div class="section"><br><h2>Why Update 1.56 Matters</h2><br><p>For longtime fans, Update 1.56 is more than just a content drop—it’s a testament to Gran Turismo 7’s staying power. The 2003 BMW Z4 3.0i brings back a fan-favorite from earlier PlayStation 3-era titles, while the 1988 Peugeot 205 GTI taps into the retro charm of the 1980s hot hatch craze. The 1962 Mercedes-Benz Unimog Type 411, however, steals the show with its sheer audacity, challenging players to rethink what a “Gran Turismo” car can be.</p><br><br><p>The new tracks, Café menu, and Sophy upgrade round out the package, offering something for everyone—whether you’re a competitive racer, a car collector, or a photography enthusiast. While the update’s scope is modest compared to milestone patches like Spec II, its diversity and accessibility make it a welcome addition as of March 1, 2025.</p><br><br><p>As players fire up their consoles to explore Update 1.56, the Gran Turismo 7 community continues to thrive. Whether you’re drifting the Z4 through Lago Maggiore, trundling the Unimog around Red Bull Ring, or hustling the 205 GTI down Grand Valley, this update invites you to celebrate the joy of driving in all its forms. Polyphony Digital has once again proven that Gran Turismo 7 is a living, breathing tribute to the automobile—and there’s plenty more road ahead.</p><br></div><br><br><p></p></div><footer><p
