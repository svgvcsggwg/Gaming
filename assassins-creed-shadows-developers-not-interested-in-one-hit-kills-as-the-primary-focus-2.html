While details continue to emerge through trailers and developer interviews, one aspect of the gameplay has sparked discussion: the role of one-hit assassinations. The game's director, Charles Benoit, has made it clear that while the iconic Hidden Blade and one-hit kills *are* present, the development team's focus is on encouraging players to embrace a more nuanced and strategic approach to stealth.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bloglr.com/media/posts/53/assassins-creed-shadows-stealth-67c557f3bc1fd296e4acf7e0.webp" alt="" width="1080" height="608" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://bloglr.com/media/posts/53/responsive/assassins-creed-shadows-stealth-67c557f3bc1fd296e4acf7e0-xs.webp 300w, https://bloglr.com/media/posts/53/responsive/assassins-creed-shadows-stealth-67c557f3bc1fd296e4acf7e0-sm.webp 480w, https://bloglr.com/media/posts/53/responsive/assassins-creed-shadows-stealth-67c557f3bc1fd296e4acf7e0-md.webp 768w"></figure><h2>A Shift in Stealth Philosophy</h2><p>From the very first <em>Assassin's Creed</em>, the ability to instantly eliminate an enemy with a well-timed Hidden Blade strike has been a core element of the gameplay. This mechanic reinforced the fantasy of being a deadly, silent assassin. However, with the release of <em>Assassin's Creed Origins</em>, Ubisoft began to shift away from guaranteed one-hit kills, tying assassination success to a leveling system and gear stats. This change was met with mixed reactions from the fanbase, with some appreciating the added RPG elements and others lamenting the loss of the classic instant-kill mechanic.</p><p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> is attempting to bridge the gap between these two approaches. In a recent interview with IGN, Charles Benoit confirmed that while the *option* for one-hit kills on all enemies will exist, it's not the intended, or even ideal, way to play the game. The developers *want* players to engage with the game's deeper stealth systems and mechanics.</p><h2>Embracing Depth and Nuance</h2><p>The development team at Ubisoft Quebec has designed <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> with a more intricate stealth system in mind. Instead of relying solely on the Hidden Blade for instant kills, players are encouraged to:</p><ul><li><strong>Utilize the Environment:</strong> The game features a dynamic lighting system, allowing players to use shadows to their advantage. Naoe, one of the two protagonists, can extinguish light sources to create areas of darkness, enhancing her stealth capabilities.</li><li><strong>Master New Mechanics:</strong> <em>Shadows</em> introduces new mechanics like the "Observe" mechanic, which provides a quick way to tag enemies, identify targets, and highlight lootable items. Naoe also has access to classic Eagle Vision, allowing her to see enemies through walls.</li><li><strong>Go Prone:</strong> For the first time in the series, characters can go prone, offering new opportunities for concealment and stealthy movement.</li><li><strong>Exploit Character-Specific Abilities:</strong> Naoe, the shinobi Assassin, is designed for stealth, with abilities like smoke bombs and shurikens. Yasuke, the samurai, can also engage in stealth, though his strengths lie in direct combat.</li><li><strong>Combine Perks and Skills:</strong> The game features a progression system with perks and skills dedicated to enhancing specific playstyles. For example, some perks might boost aerial assassination damage, while others improve stealth in darkness.</li><li><strong>Double Assassinations:</strong> If the players use the Tanto as their primary weapon, then the classic double assassinations can also be used.</li><li><strong>Enemy Awareness:</strong> A major change to the mechanics is that eagle companions are gone. The player will have to rely more on their main characters senses.</li></ul><p>This emphasis on a more multifaceted approach to stealth is intended to provide a more rewarding and engaging experience. It encourages players to think strategically, observe their surroundings, and utilize all the tools at their disposal. This moves beyond a simple "press button to kill" approach and promotes a greater sense of player agency and creativity.</p><h2>The "One-Hit Kill" Option: A Matter of Choice</h2><p>Despite the focus on deeper stealth mechanics, Ubisoft understands that some players prefer the classic <em>Assassin's Creed</em> experience. Therefore, <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> *will* include an option to enable guaranteed one-hit assassinations on all enemies. This option can be toggled in the game's settings menu.</p><p>This approach mirrors that taken in <em>Assassin's Creed Valhalla</em>, which also offered a "guaranteed assassination" option. It allows players to tailor the gameplay experience to their preferences, catering to both those who enjoy the challenge of the RPG-influenced assassination system and those who prefer the immediate gratification of one-hit kills.</p><p>However it is not a binary system, but instead of damage, health segments will be used. Regular enemies only have one, with stronger enemies having 2,3 or even 4. Depending on skills or abilities of the character, that amount of segments removed from the enemy after a stealth attack, can be changed.</p><h2>Enemy Design and Assassination Challenges</h2><p>Without the guaranteed one-hit kill option enabled, the effectiveness of assassinations will depend on several factors, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Enemy Level and Health:</strong> Stronger enemies will have larger health bars (represented by segments), making them more resistant to assassination attempts.</li><li><strong>Health Segments:</strong> Enemies in *Assassin's Creed Shadows* will have visible health bars, that will be segmented, instead of an abstract amount of damage points that needs to be applied to the enemies.</li><li><strong>Player Skills and Gear:</strong> Investing in skills and acquiring gear that enhance assassination damage will increase the likelihood of a successful one-hit kill. There are many ways that the player can specilize either Naoe or Yasuke.</li><li><strong>Contextual Factors:</strong> Certain perks and abilities may provide bonuses in specific situations, such as air assassinations or attacks performed in darkness.</li><li><strong>Assassination Weakness:</strong> Certain enemy types may have their own specific assassination weakness. For example, some enemies are more vulnerable to air attacks, while others have a weak spot for headshots.</li></ul><p>This system introduces a level of risk and reward to assassinations. Players will need to assess the situation, consider their target's strength, and choose the most appropriate approach. A failed assassination attempt can alert nearby enemies, forcing the player to adapt and either engage in direct combat or attempt to re-enter stealth.</p><h2>Two Protagonists, Two Playstyles</h2><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> features two distinct protagonists: Naoe, a skilled shinobi Assassin, and Yasuke, a powerful samurai based on the historical figure of the same name. This dual-protagonist system further emphasizes the game's focus on player choice and diverse gameplay approaches.</p><ul><li><strong>Naoe:</strong> Designed for stealth, Naoe embodies the classic Assassin archetype. Her abilities and tools are geared towards silent infiltration, evasion, and swift assassinations.</li><li><strong>Yasuke:</strong> While capable of stealth, Yasuke is primarily a combat-focused character. He can withstand more damage and excels in direct confrontations.</li></ul><p>Players can switch between Naoe and Yasuke, allowing them to tackle missions in different ways. A stealthy approach with Naoe might be ideal for one objective, while a more direct, combat-oriented approach with Yasuke might be better suited for another.</p><h2>Release Date and Platforms</h2><p>After some reported delays, <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> is currently scheduled for release on March 20, 2025. It will be available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, macOS and iPadOS. The system requirements are as followed:</p><ul><li>Minimum System Requirements<ul><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li><li>OS: Windows 10/11</li><li>Processor: Intel® Core™ i7 8700k/AMD Ryzen™ 5 3600</li><li>Memory: 16 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: Nvidia® GeForce GTX™ 1070 8 GB/AMD Radeon™ RX 5700 8 GB/Intel® Arc™ A580 8GB (REBAR ON)</li><li>DirectX: Version 12</li></ul></li><li>Recommended System Requirements<ul><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li><li>OS: Windows 10/11</li><li>Processor: Intel® Core™ i5 11600k/AMD Ryzen™ 5 5600x</li><li>Memory: 16 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: Nvidia® GeForce RTX™ 3060Ti 8GB/AMD Radeon™ RX 6700 XT 12GB/Intel® Arc™ B580 12GB (REBAR ON)</li><li>DirectX: Version 12</li></ul></li></ul><p>You will need more than 100 GB of free storage</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> represents a significant evolution in the series' approach to stealth gameplay. While the option for classic one-hit assassinations remains, the developers are clearly encouraging players to explore a richer, more nuanced, and ultimately more rewarding stealth experience. The game's dynamic lighting, expanded movement options, character-specific abilities, and emphasis on environmental interaction all point towards a more strategic and engaging gameplay loop. Whether players choose to embrace this new depth or stick with the familiar comfort of instant kills, <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> promises to offer a unique and compelling journey through Feudal Japan.</p></div><footer><p class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on March 3, 2025</p><div class="content__tags-share"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://bloglr.com/tags/game-review/">Game Review</a></li><li><a href="https://bloglr.com/tags/playstation/">PlayStation</a></li><li><a href="https://bloglr.com/tags/xbox/">Xbox</a></li></ul><aside class="content__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbloglr.com%2Fassassins-creed-shadows-developers-not-interested-in-one-hit-kills-as-the-primary-focus-2.html" class="js-share facebook" aria-label="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://bloglr.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbloglr.com%2Fassassins-creed-shadows-developers-not-interested-in-one-hit-kills-as-the-primary-focus-2.html&amp;via=bloglr&amp;text=Assassin's%20Creed%20Shadows%20Developers%20Not%20Interested%20in%20One-Hit%20Kills%20(As%20the%20Primary%20Focus)" class="js-share twitter" aria-label="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://bloglr.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbloglr.com%2Fassassins-creed-shadows-developers-not-interested-in-one-hit-kills-as-the-primary-focus-2.html&amp;media=undefined&amp;description=Assassin's%20Creed%20Shadows%20Developers%20Not%20Interested%20in%20One-Hit%20Kills%20(As%20the%20Primary%20Focus)" class="js-share pinterest" aria-label="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://bloglr.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg></a></aside></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h6 bio__name"><a href="https://bloglr.com/authors/karen/" class="invert" title="Karen">Karen</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>To me, video games are more than just fun – they're a serious art form and a big industry that deserves to be looked at closely.
