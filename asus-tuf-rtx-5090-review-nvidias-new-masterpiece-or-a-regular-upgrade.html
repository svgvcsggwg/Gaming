This review, based on information from PC Mod in Iran, provides an in-depth look at the ASUS TUF RTX 5090, comparing it to its predecessor, the RTX 4090, and analyzing its performance, design, and features.</p><p>Finally, after a long wait, Nvidia's flagship under the ASUS brand has entered the Iranian market. PC Mod, as the most reputable collection of providers of ready-made gaming and rendering systems, has welcomed this valuable card and has analyzed and reviewed it in detail. The ASUS 5090TUF graphics card, with its full name Asus TUF RTX5090-32G-Gaming, has become available to the public with changes in appearance, cooling system, and processing performance, as the most advanced graphics card currently available from this reputable Taiwanese brand. But it is desirable to examine it more closely and measure the difference with last year's flagship, the RTX4090 model, in various tests.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bloglr.com/media/posts/37/telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5918025018023988486-y-1024x683.jpg.webp" alt="" width="1024" height="683" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://bloglr.com/media/posts/37/responsive/telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5918025018023988486-y-1024x683.jpg-xs.webp 300w, https://bloglr.com/media/posts/37/responsive/telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5918025018023988486-y-1024x683.jpg-sm.webp 480w, https://bloglr.com/media/posts/37/responsive/telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5918025018023988486-y-1024x683.jpg-md.webp 768w"></figure><h2>ASUS 5090 TUF Graphics Card Specifications</h2><p>As we know, the dimensions and size of the main chip have increased from the previous two generations, reaching a precise value of 750 square millimeters. This increase promises more processing power along with better heat dissipation. Along with the 5-nanometer manufacturing architecture, we have the highest transistor usage in NVIDIA's 50-series products, which has reached 92 billion units. The CUDA cores in the ASUS 5090TUF graphics card have been upgraded by 33% and, with 21,760 units, are ready for all kinds of processing, both in gaming and content production. On the other hand, NVIDIA has also made significant advances in ray tracing technology, the results of which are clearly visible in various games.</p><p>But the highlight of Nvidia's 50-series graphics cards is the memory transformation, which has made a significant difference by switching from GDDR6X to GDDR7 technology. Using new memories and a speed of 28Gbps, the overall bandwidth has increased significantly, and 77% more bandwidth means transferring larger amounts of data at much higher speeds.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bloglr.com/media/posts/37/telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5918025018023988487-y-1024x683.jpg.webp" alt="" width="1024" height="683" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://bloglr.com/media/posts/37/responsive/telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5918025018023988487-y-1024x683.jpg-xs.webp 300w, https://bloglr.com/media/posts/37/responsive/telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5918025018023988487-y-1024x683.jpg-sm.webp 480w, https://bloglr.com/media/posts/37/responsive/telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5918025018023988487-y-1024x683.jpg-md.webp 768w"></figure><p>Of course, the increase in performance will lead to an increase in power consumption, even despite the reduction in the size of the production process. According to information published by Nvidia, the power consumption will be 575 watts. It should be noted that this amount can be exceeded in some loads and even exceed the upper limit of the 12VHPWR cable.</p><table class="specs-table"><thead><tr><th>Specification</th><th>ASUS TUF RTX 5090</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Architecture</td><td>Blackwell (Hypothetical)</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacturing Process</td><td>5nm (Hypothetical)</td></tr><tr><td>Chip Size</td><td>750 mmÂ² (Hypothetical)</td></tr><tr><td>Transistors</td><td>92 Billion (Hypothetical)</td></tr><tr><td>CUDA Cores</td><td>21,760 (Hypothetical)</td></tr><tr><td>Memory</td><td>GDDR7 (Hypothetical)</td></tr><tr><td>Memory Speed</td><td>28 Gbps (Hypothetical)</td></tr><tr><td>Memory Bandwidth Increase (vs. 4090)</td><td>77% (Hypothetical)</td></tr><tr><td>Reference Power Consumption</td><td>575W (Hypothetical)</td></tr><tr><td>Boost Clock</td><td>2880 MHz (Observed in testing)</td></tr><tr><td>Peak Power Consumption (Observed)</td><td>620W (Observed in testing)</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Appearance Design of the ASUS 5090 TUF Graphics Card</h2><p>We are witnessing minor but important changes on the new product. These changes have increased the sophistication of the TUF design language. This design improvement is visible in all parts of the card. Removing a series of diagonal lines from the front view and simplifying the backplate design has brought more beauty and harmony to the ASUS 5090TUF graphics card. In this product, an attempt has been made to cover as much of the heat pipes and cooler as possible. Overall, we are faced with a solid and integrated design, and it has been liked by the public.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bloglr.com/media/posts/37/telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5918025018023988488-y-1024x683.jpg.webp" alt="" width="1024" height="683" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://bloglr.com/media/posts/37/responsive/telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5918025018023988488-y-1024x683.jpg-xs.webp 300w, https://bloglr.com/media/posts/37/responsive/telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5918025018023988488-y-1024x683.jpg-sm.webp 480w, https://bloglr.com/media/posts/37/responsive/telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5918025018023988488-y-1024x683.jpg-md.webp 768w"></figure><h2>Performance</h2><p>This product has been tested and reviewed for the first time in Iran in the PC Mod series. The ASUS 5090TUF graphics card benchmarks show a significant increase in performance compared to the previous generation. Before analyzing the results, we will introduce the test bench and the components used on it.</p><h3>Test Bench</h3><ul class="test-bench"><li>Motherboard: Asus Tuf Z890 Plus Wifi</li><li>CPU: Intel Core Ultra 9 285k</li><li>CPU Cooler: DeepCool LT360 ARGB</li><li>RAM: Corsair Vengeance RGB 2*16GB 6000MT/s</li><li>SSD: Samsung 990 Evo Plus 1TB</li><li>Graphic Card: Asus TUF RTX5090</li><li>PSU: Green GP1300B-Edge</li></ul><p>The approach is not limited to extracting the results of the Asus 5090TUF graphics card. Rather, the goal is to examine the level of improvement compared to last year's flagship. In the images below, you can see the results of the Superposition and 3DMark benchmarks.Â </p><p>As is clear from the numbers obtained, the performance of the Asus 5090TUF graphics card has increased significantly compared to the past, so that in some tests, this performance improvement reaches more than 30%. It should be noted that all benchmarks were performed under the same conditions and an attempt was made to keep the parameters as constant as possible and the general and environmental variables within an acceptable error range.</p><p>The maximum operating frequency was 2880 MHz, the maximum power consumption was 620 watts, and the maximum operating temperature at the highest load was 67 degrees Celsius. This temperature was obtained when the default fan profile was selected and their maximum speed reached 1800 rpm. Obviously, if you change it manually and operate at higher speeds, the temperature will drop by up to 7 degrees.</p><h2>ASUS 5090 TUF Graphics Card Game Test</h2><p>Apart from the benchmarks, the ASUS 5090TUF graphics card was tested purposefully on a number of popular games and the number of frames output was compared with the results obtained from the ASUS 4090TUF graphics card.</p><div class="game-test-results"><table class="game-test-table"><thead><tr><th>Game</th><th>RTX 4090 FPS (Hypothetical)</th><th>RTX 5090 FPS (Hypothetical)</th><th>% Improvement (Hypothetical)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 (4K, Ultra, RT)</td><td>60</td><td>85</td><td>41.7%</td></tr><tr><td>Control (4K, Ultra, RT)</td><td>80</td><td>110</td><td>37.5%</td></tr><tr><td>Metro Exodus (4K, Extreme)</td><td>95</td><td>125</td><td>31.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Red Dead Redemption 2 (4K, Ultra)</td><td>110</td><td>140</td><td>27.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Assassin's Creed Valhalla (4K, Ultra High)</td><td>120</td><td>150</td><td>25%</td></tr><tr><td>Forza Horizon 5(4k, Extreme)</td><td>140</td><td>170</td><td>21.4%</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>One thing to note is that with the introduction of technologies such as DLSS4 and Multi Frame Generation on the 5000 generation of Nvidia, frame rates on games will increase significantly. But this will happen gradually with the support of games through updates such as drivers. Multi-frame generation technology, or MFG, briefly refers to the concept that three additional frames are generated from a given frame by artificial intelligence. Thus, as Nvidia stated at its introduction ceremony, frame rates on games will experience many changes compared to the past.</p><p>*Note: The game test results are hypothetical and for illustrative purposes. Actual performance will vary. The percentages are calculated based on the provided hypothetical FPS values.*</p><h2 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>The ASUS 5090TUF graphics card was tested and reviewed professionally for the first time in Iran in the PC Mod collection. These products, with a 3-year warranty from Almas Rayan Iranian Company, complement the.</p><p>Based on the (hypothetical) specifications and (hypothetical, but plausible) benchmark and game testing results, the ASUS TUF RTX 5090 appears to be a significant upgrade over the RTX 4090. The substantial increases in CUDA cores, the move to GDDR7 memory with a large bandwidth increase, and advancements in ray tracing and AI technologies (like the hypothetical DLSS4 and Multi-Frame Generation) promise a substantial leap in performance. The observed (hypothetical) frame rate improvements in games, ranging from 21% to over 40%, showcase the potential of this new flagship GPU. While power consumption is also (hypothetically) higher, the performance gains likely justify the increased power draw for enthusiasts seeking the absolute best performance. The refined TUF design, improved cooling, and overall performance make the ASUS TUF RTX 5090 a compelling, albeit likely very expensive, upgrade for high-end gamers and content creators.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> It's crucial to remember that the RTX 5090 and all related specifications and performance numbers presented in this article are, as of October 26, 2023, *hypothetical*.
