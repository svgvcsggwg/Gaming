While the game has garnered a mixed reception, with praise for its combat and exploration alongside criticism for its static world and perceived lack of depth, its player numbers tell a compelling story of a game finding its audience. This article delves into the details of <em>Avowed</em>'s success, explores the factors contributing to its popularity, examines the criticisms it has faced, and looks ahead to the potential future of the franchise.</p><h2>A Strong Launch: Millions Dive into the Living Lands</h2><p>According to data estimations from mindGAME, <em>Avowed</em> attracted an impressive 5.9 million players in its launch month. This figure significantly outpaces <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, which garnered 4 million players within the same timeframe. It's important to note that these are not official figures released by Obsidian or Microsoft. mindGAME's estimations take into account various metrics, including Xbox Game Pass users, Steam concurrent players, search volume, and video content engagement. While not definitive, these estimations offer a strong indication of <em>Avowed</em>'s widespread appeal.</p><p>The game's availability on Xbox Game Pass likely played a significant role in its high player count. Many of the 5.9 million players probably accessed the game through the subscription service, rather than purchasing it outright. However, <em>Avowed</em> also performed well on Steam, peaking at nearly 20,000 concurrent players shortly after launch. This demonstrates the game's appeal beyond the Game Pass ecosystem, suggesting strong word-of-mouth and positive player experiences.</p><h2>Contrasting Reception: Critical Acclaim vs. Player Numbers</h2><p>Interestingly, <em>Avowed</em>'s impressive player count contrasts with its somewhat mixed critical reception. While many reviewers praised the game's magic-based combat system, vibrant world, and engaging exploration, others criticized its "static world," "boring NPCs," and a perceived lack of reactivity to player actions. This has led to comparisons with <em>The Elder Scrolls</em> series, particularly <em>Skyrim</em>, with some critics arguing that <em>Avowed</em> falls short of the immersive depth offered by Bethesda's landmark RPG.</p><p><em>Avowed</em> currently holds a Metacritic score of 78/100 (PC) and 81/100 (Xbox Series X/S), indicating "generally favorable reviews." User scores, however, are slightly lower, reflecting the more divided opinions among players. Some user reviews echo the criticisms leveled by professional critics, while others express enthusiastic praise for the game, highlighting its enjoyable combat, intriguing lore, and rewarding exploration.</p><p>The disparity between player numbers and critical reception suggests that <em>Avowed</em>, despite its flaws, has resonated with a large audience. This could be attributed to several factors, including its availability on Game Pass, the reputation of Obsidian Entertainment, and the inherent appeal of a new fantasy RPG set in the <em>Pillars of Eternity</em> universe. It is also worth noting that the player number of another title "Indiana Jones and the Great Circle" was able to get a higher Metacritic score of 86, but a lower overall player count.</p><h2>The Allure of Eora: A World Ripe for Exploration</h2><p><em>Avowed</em> is set in the world of Eora, previously established in Obsidian's critically acclaimed <em>Pillars of Eternity</em> series. This established lore and world-building likely contributed to the game's appeal, drawing in fans of the previous games eager to explore a new corner of Eora. The Living Lands, the region where <em>Avowed</em> takes place, is presented as a vibrant and diverse environment, filled with ancient ruins, mysterious creatures, and intriguing quests.</p><p>Many players have praised the game's environmental storytelling, with details scattered throughout the world that enrich the narrative and reward exploration. While some critics have argued that the world feels "static" compared to other open-world RPGs, others have lauded its beauty and the sense of discovery it provides.</p><h2>Combat: A Highlight Amidst the Criticism</h2><p>One aspect of <em>Avowed</em> that has received near-universal praise is its combat system. The game offers a variety of combat styles, allowing players to wield swords, shields, wands, guns, and grimoires. The ability to mix and match these weapons and spells creates a dynamic and engaging combat experience. Many players have particularly enjoyed the magic system, describing it as "fun" and "satisfying," with spells like chain lightning adding a visually spectacular and powerful element to encounters.</p><p>Some reviews have suggested that the combat in <em>Avowed</em> surpasses that of <em>The Outer Worlds</em>, another Obsidian title. This bodes well for the upcoming <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, suggesting that the developers are continuing to refine and improve their combat systems.</p><p>The focus on fluid and skill-based combat, rather than purely relying on RPG statistics, seems to have resonated with players. This, coupled with the variety of weapon and spell combinations, has likely contributed to <em>Avowed</em>'s overall appeal, even for those who may have reservations about other aspects of the game.</p><h2>Addressing the Criticisms: A Static World and Unresponsive NPCs</h2><p>The most common criticisms leveled against <em>Avowed</em> center on its perceived lack of interactivity and a "static" world. Many critics and players have pointed out that NPCs lack daily schedules and do not react to player actions in a meaningful way. This contrasts sharply with games like <em>Skyrim</em>, where NPCs have routines, shops have opening and closing hours, and the player's actions can have noticeable consequences on the world.</p><p>Some argue that this lack of reactivity detracts from the game's immersion, making the world feel less alive and believable. Others, however, have defended Obsidian's design choices, arguing that they prioritize gameplay flow and prevent unnecessary downtime. For instance, the absence of NPC schedules eliminates the frustration of waiting for a shop to open, streamlining the player experience.</p><p>Obsidian has acknowledged some of these criticisms and has stated that they are happy with sales and that player have "raved" about the game. This openness to feedback suggests that future updates or potential sequels could address these concerns, further enhancing the game's interactivity and responsiveness.</p><h2>Comparisons to The Elder Scrolls: A Double-Edged Sword</h2><p>The inevitable comparisons to <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> have been a constant theme in discussions surrounding <em>Avowed</em>. While some see these comparisons as unfair, given <em>Avowed</em>'s smaller scope and different design goals, others argue that they are unavoidable, considering <em>Skyrim</em>'s status as a genre-defining masterpiece.</p><p>Obsidian themselves have sought to distance <em>Avowed</em> from <em>Skyrim</em>, emphasizing that their game is not intended to be a direct competitor. They have described <em>Avowed</em>'s world as smaller but more richly detailed, with a more linear main story that still encourages exploration and player choice. Some have suggested that <em>Avowed</em> has a similar feel to <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> or <em>The Outer Worlds</em>, other Obsidian titles known for their strong writing and branching narratives.</p><p>While the comparisons to <em>Skyrim</em> may have initially raised expectations for <em>Avowed</em>, they have also likely contributed to its visibility and attracted players curious to see how Obsidian would tackle a first-person fantasy RPG. Ultimately, <em>Avowed</em> stands on its own merits, offering a unique experience that, while not without its flaws, has clearly resonated with a large audience.</p><h2>The Future of Avowed: DLC, Sequels, and Beyond</h2><p>The success of <em>Avowed</em> has opened up possibilities for the future of the franchise. Obsidian's director, Carrie Patel, has expressed her desire to "do more" with the world of Eora, hinting at potential DLC or even a sequel. While no concrete plans have been announced, the positive reception and strong player numbers suggest that further development in the <em>Avowed</em> universe is likely.</p><p>Some players have expressed a desire for features to be added to the game, such as the ability to change their appearance after character creation. Others have called for improvements to the game's interactivity and NPC behavior. Obsidian's openness to feedback and their track record of supporting their games with post-launch updates suggest that these requests may be addressed in the future.</p><p>Beyond <em>Avowed</em>, Obsidian is also working on <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, scheduled for release in 2025. The success of <em>Avowed</em> could potentially influence the development of <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, with Obsidian perhaps incorporating some of the lessons learned from their latest RPG. There's also been discussion of a potential <em>Pillars of Eternity Tactics</em> game, further expanding the universe in which <em>Avowed</em> is set. Josh Sawyer, director of <em>Pillars of Eternity</em> and <em>Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire</em>, has expressed the studio's interest in developing such a game, although the scope and budget remain key considerations.</p><h2>A Look at the Competition: Black Ops 6</h2><p>While <em>Avowed</em> has outperformed <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, it pales in comparison to the player numbers of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>. Early estimations suggested that <em>Black Ops 6</em> garnered 26.2 million players in its first month, dwarfing <em>Avowed</em>'s 5.9 million.</p><p>However, it's important to note that these are vastly different games, with different target audiences and development budgets. Comparing a new fantasy RPG to a long-running, established franchise like <em>Call of Duty</em> is arguably an unfair comparison. <em>Black Ops 6</em>, released in October 2024, has itself seen a significant drop in player numbers in recent months. Reports indicate that the game lost a substantial portion of its player base, with some attributing the decline to dissatisfaction with certain aspects of the game, including monetization practices.</p><p>More recent figures from January 2025 showed further drops, and even the release of Season 2 content in January 2025 failed to significantly reignite player interest. While <em>Black Ops 6</em> remains a popular game, its declining player count highlights the challenges of maintaining long-term engagement in the competitive gaming market. Black Ops 6 had an estimated <em>245,500</em> monthly active players and <em>56,244</em> online players 1 hour before March 3, 2025.</p><h2>Conclusion: A Solid Foundation for the Future</h2><p><em>Avowed</em>'s journey has been a fascinating one. Despite facing criticisms and comparisons to genre giants, the game has achieved significant success, attracting millions of players and establishing a solid foundation for future development. Its engaging combat, intriguing world, and availability on Game Pass have all contributed to its popularity.</p><p>While <em>Avowed</em> may not be a perfect game, it represents a promising entry in the first-person fantasy RPG genre. Obsidian Entertainment has demonstrated its ability to create compelling worlds and engaging gameplay experiences, and the future of the <em>Avowed</em> franchise looks bright. Whether through DLC, sequels, or further exploration of the <em>Pillars of Eternity</em> universe, Obsidian has the opportunity to build upon <em>Avowed</em>'s success and solidify its place as a leading developer of RPGs. The game's success also reflects the evolving landscape of the gaming industry, where subscription services like Game Pass can play a significant role in a game's reach and popularity. As Obsidian continues to refine its craft and listen to player feedback, the future of <em>Avowed</em> and its subsequent projects holds considerable promise.</p></div><footer><p class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on March 3, 2025</p><div class="content__tags-share"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://bloglr.com/tags/game-review/">Game Review</a></li><li><a href="https://bloglr.com/tags/playstation/">PlayStation</a></li><li><a href="https://bloglr.com/tags/xbox/">Xbox</a></li></ul><aside class="content__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbloglr.com%2Favowed-a-surprising-success-story-amidst-mixed-reviews.html" class="js-share facebook" aria-label="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://bloglr.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbloglr.com%2Favowed-a-surprising-success-story-amidst-mixed-reviews.html&amp;via=bloglr&amp;text=Avowed%3A%20A%20Surprising%20Success%20Story%20Amidst%20Mixed%20Reviews" class="js-share twitter" aria-label="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://bloglr.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbloglr.com%2Favowed-a-surprising-success-story-amidst-mixed-reviews.html&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fbloglr.com%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F56%2Favowed-67c54cabbc1fd296e4acf7af.jpg&amp;description=Avowed%3A%20A%20Surprising%20Success%20Story%20Amidst%20Mixed%20Reviews" class="js-share pinterest" aria-label="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://bloglr.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg></a></aside></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h6 bio__name"><a href="https://bloglr.com/authors/william/" class="invert" title="William">William</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>I've been playing games since I was a kid, and I love them more every day.
