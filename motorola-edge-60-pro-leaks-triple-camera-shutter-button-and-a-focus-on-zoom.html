Reports suggest that Motorola is making some noteworthy changes, particularly in the camera department, aiming to differentiate the Edge 60 series in a crowded market. This article will delve into the leaked details, explore the potential implications, and discuss how these phones might fit into Motorola's broader strategy.</p><h2>A Redesigned Camera System: Uniformity and a Dedicated Shutter Button</h2><p>One of the most striking changes revealed in the leaks, reported by Winfuture, is the redesigned camera module. Previous Edge models often featured camera lenses of varying sizes, creating a somewhat asymmetrical look. The Edge 60 series, however, appears to be moving towards a more uniform design. Leaked images show four identically sized circles within the camera module, although one of these is actually the LED flash, not a camera lens. This design choice lends a cleaner, more modern aesthetic to the phone.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bloglr.com/media/posts/49/csm_Edge-60-3_3595845588.jpg.webp" alt="" width="738" height="333" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://bloglr.com/media/posts/49/responsive/csm_Edge-60-3_3595845588.jpg-xs.webp 300w, https://bloglr.com/media/posts/49/responsive/csm_Edge-60-3_3595845588.jpg-sm.webp 480w, https://bloglr.com/media/posts/49/responsive/csm_Edge-60-3_3595845588.jpg-md.webp 768w"></figure><p>The Edge 60 Pro, in particular, seems to be borrowing design cues from its predecessor, the Edge 50 Pro, but with some key refinements. The leaked images show a display with more pronounced curves on the sides, contributing to a more premium feel. Perhaps the most significant addition for photography enthusiasts is the dedicated shutter button located on the left side of the device. This physical button provides a more tactile and traditional camera experience, making it easier to capture shots quickly and precisely, especially in situations where using the on-screen shutter button might be cumbersome.</p><h2>Differentiating the Models: Edge 60 vs. Edge 60 Pro</h2><p>The reports suggest that while the Edge 60 and Edge 60 Pro share a similar design language, they will be differentiated by their camera capabilities. This suggests a clear strategy from Motorola: offer a standard model for everyday users and a "Pro" model with enhanced camera features for those who prioritize mobile photography.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bloglr.com/media/posts/49/csm_Edge-60-Pro3_fa797ba288.jpg.webp" alt="" width="738" height="315" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://bloglr.com/media/posts/49/responsive/csm_Edge-60-Pro3_fa797ba288.jpg-xs.webp 300w, https://bloglr.com/media/posts/49/responsive/csm_Edge-60-Pro3_fa797ba288.jpg-sm.webp 480w, https://bloglr.com/media/posts/49/responsive/csm_Edge-60-Pro3_fa797ba288.jpg-md.webp 768w"></figure><h3>Motorola Edge 60 (Standard):</h3><p>The standard Edge 60 is rumored to feature a 50-megapixel main camera utilizing a Sony Lytia sensor. This sensor is paired with optical image stabilization (OIS), a crucial feature for reducing blur in photos and videos, especially in low-light conditions. The main camera will reportedly use a lens with a 24mm focal length, providing a standard wide-angle perspective suitable for everyday photography. This setup suggests a capable primary camera that should perform well in a variety of shooting scenarios.</p><p>Alongside the main camera, the Edge 60 is expected to include an ultrawide lens with a 12mm focal length. This lens will allow users to capture a much wider field of view, making it ideal for landscapes, group shots, or architectural photography. The presence of an ultrawide lens adds versatility to the camera system, giving users more creative options.</p><p>However, the third camera on the standard Edge 60 is reportedly a 2-megapixel sensor. While the exact purpose of this sensor hasn't been confirmed, it's likely to be either a depth sensor for portrait mode effects or a macro lens for close-up shots. Given its low resolution, it's unlikely to contribute significantly to the overall image quality, and the reports suggest it may be more "decorative" than functional. This is a common strategy in mid-range phones, where manufacturers sometimes include low-resolution sensors to increase the camera count for marketing purposes.</p><table class="spec-table"><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Motorola Edge 60 (Rumored)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Main Camera</td><td>50MP (Sony Lytia), OIS, 24mm focal length</td></tr><tr><td>Ultrawide Camera</td><td>12mm focal length</td></tr><tr><td>Third Camera</td><td>2MP (likely depth or macro)</td></tr><tr><td>Shutter Button</td><td>No</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Motorola Edge 60 Pro:</h3><p>The Edge 60 Pro, as the name suggests, steps up the camera game significantly. The key differentiator is the inclusion of a telephoto camera with a 73mm focal length, providing approximately 3x optical zoom. Optical zoom is far superior to digital zoom, as it uses the lens itself to magnify the image, preserving detail and clarity. Digital zoom, on the other hand, simply crops and enlarges a portion of the image from the main sensor, resulting in a loss of quality.</p><p>Motorola is reportedly branding this camera system as "Super Zoom," clearly emphasizing the phone's zooming capabilities. This suggests that Motorola is targeting users who value the ability to capture distant subjects without sacrificing image quality. The 3x optical zoom is a versatile range, suitable for portraits, wildlife photography, or simply getting closer to the action in everyday situations.</p><p>The other camera specifics of the Edge 60 Pro aren't yet specified, but it is reasonable to expect them to be at least on par, if not superior, to the standard model. It's likely that the Pro version would maintain the 50MP main sensor (possibly an even higher-end sensor from Sony) and an improved Ultrawide sensor as well.</p><table class="spec-table"><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Motorola Edge 60 Pro (Rumored)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Main Camera</td><td>Likely 50MP or higher, OIS (Assumed)</td></tr><tr><td>Ultrawide Camera</td><td>Likely present (specifications unknown)</td></tr><tr><td>Telephoto Camera</td><td>73mm focal length, 3x optical zoom ("Super Zoom")</td></tr><tr><td>Shutter Button</td><td>Yes (dedicated button)</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Cost-Cutting Measures: A Plastic Frame?</h2><p>While the camera upgrades are exciting, the reports also suggest a potential cost-cutting measure. It's rumored that Motorola may be using a plastic frame for the Edge 60 series, rather than the more premium metal frames found in some competing devices and previous Edge models. This decision, if true, would likely help Motorola keep the price of the Edge 60 series competitive in the mid-range segment.</p><p>The use of a plastic frame doesn't necessarily mean a compromise in build quality. Modern plastics can be quite durable and lightweight, and a well-designed plastic frame can still feel solid and premium. However, it's a factor that some consumers may consider, especially those who prefer the feel of metal in their hands.</p><h2>Other Expected Specifications (Unconfirmed):</h2><p>While the leaked information primarily focuses on the camera and design, there are some other specifications we can reasonably expect from the Edge 60 series, based on previous models and industry trends:</p><ul><li><strong>Display:</strong> Both models are likely to feature OLED displays with high refresh rates (likely 120Hz or 144Hz) for smooth scrolling and animations. The Pro model might have a slightly larger and higher-resolution display.</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> The Edge 60 series will likely be powered by a mid-range Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, possibly from the Snapdragon 7 series or even a slightly older Snapdragon 8 series chip to balance performance and cost.</li><li><strong>RAM and Storage:</strong> We can expect multiple RAM and storage configurations, likely starting with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, with higher-end options available.</li><li><strong>Battery:</strong> Battery capacity is likely to be in the 4500mAh to 5000mAh range, with support for fast charging.</li><li><strong>Software:</strong> The phones will almost certainly run Android, likely with Motorola's My UX skin on top. Motorola typically offers a relatively clean Android experience with some added features and customization options.</li><li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> 5G connectivity will be standard, along with Wi-Fi 6 or 6E, Bluetooth 5.2 or later, and NFC.</li></ul><h2>Positioning and Competition</h2><p>The Motorola Edge 60 series is positioning itself in a highly competitive mid-range smartphone market. It will face competition from devices like the Samsung Galaxy A series, Google Pixel a series, OnePlus Nord series, and various offerings from Xiaomi, Realme, and Oppo. The success of the Edge 60 series will depend on its pricing, overall performance, and how well its camera features stack up against the competition.</p><p>Motorola's strategy of offering a standard model and a "Pro" model with enhanced camera features is a smart move. It allows them to cater to a wider range of consumers and compete more effectively with brands that offer similar tiered product lineups. The emphasis on zoom capabilities in the Edge 60 Pro could be a key differentiator, as this is a feature that is often lacking in mid-range phones.</p><h2>Release Date and Pricing</h2><p>As of now, Motorola has not officially announced the release date or pricing for the Edge 60 series. However, the reports suggest that the phones will be unveiled "in the coming weeks." Given the leaked information and the typical release cycle of Motorola phones, a launch in the near future seems likely. Pricing will be crucial for the success of these devices. They will need to be priced competitively to stand out in the crowded mid-range market. The standard Edge 60 might fall in line where previous entries into the market, while the Edge 60 Pro might come in as a slight increase given its upgraded camera array.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The leaked information about the Motorola Edge 60 and Edge 60 Pro paints a picture of two promising mid-range smartphones. The redesigned camera system, particularly the "Super Zoom" capabilities of the Edge 60 Pro, and the inclusion of a dedicated shutter button, are noteworthy additions. The potential use of a plastic frame is a possible cost-cutting measure, but it remains to be seen how this will affect the overall build quality and feel of the devices. Ultimately, the success of the Edge 60 series will depend on the final specifications, pricing, and how well Motorola executes its vision for these devices. The coming weeks will reveal whether these leaks accurately reflect the final product and whether Motorola can successfully carve out a niche for itself in the competitive mid-range smartphone market. The focus on a "Pro" camera experience within the mid-range market is a compelling angle, and one that might resonate with consumers.</p></div><footer><p class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on March 3, 2025</p><div class="content__tags-share"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://bloglr.com/tags/hardware/">Hardware</a></li><li><a href="https://bloglr.com/tags/mobile/">Mobile</a></li></ul><aside class="content__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbloglr.com%2Fmotorola-edge-60-pro-leaks-triple-camera-shutter-button-and-a-focus-on-zoom.html" class="js-share facebook" aria-label="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://bloglr.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbloglr.com%2Fmotorola-edge-60-pro-leaks-triple-camera-shutter-button-and-a-focus-on-zoom.html&amp;via=bloglr&amp;text=Motorola%20Edge%2060%20Pro%20Leaks%3A%20Triple%20Camera%2C%20Shutter%20Button%2C%20and%20a%20Focus%20on%20Zoom" class="js-share twitter" aria-label="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://bloglr.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbloglr.com%2Fmotorola-edge-60-pro-leaks-triple-camera-shutter-button-and-a-focus-on-zoom.html&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fbloglr.com%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F49%2Fcsm_Edge-60-3_97c9a0d49e-910x600.jpg.webp&amp;description=Motorola%20Edge%2060%20Pro%20Leaks%3A%20Triple%20Camera%2C%20Shutter%20Button%2C%20and%20a%20Focus%20on%20Zoom" class="js-share pinterest" aria-label="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://bloglr.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg></a></aside></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h6 bio__name"><a href="https://bloglr.com/authors/felix/" class="invert" title="Felix">Felix</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>Video games are a massive part of who I am.
