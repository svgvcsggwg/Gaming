Recently, AMD launched its Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards, based on the new RDNA 4 architecture, and they've immediately made waves. These cards are not only competitively priced but also promise to address the supply issues that have plagued recent Nvidia releases. This article will delve into the details of the RX 9070 series, examining its specifications, performance, pricing, availability, and the broader implications for the GPU market.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bloglr.com/media/posts/41/amd-radeon-rx-9070-series-67c40185e07da2dcd11dcae1.webp" alt="" width="750" height="422" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://bloglr.com/media/posts/41/responsive/amd-radeon-rx-9070-series-67c40185e07da2dcd11dcae1-xs.webp 300w, https://bloglr.com/media/posts/41/responsive/amd-radeon-rx-9070-series-67c40185e07da2dcd11dcae1-sm.webp 480w, https://bloglr.com/media/posts/41/responsive/amd-radeon-rx-9070-series-67c40185e07da2dcd11dcae1-md.webp 768w"></figure><h2>The RDNA 4 Architecture: An Evolution, Not a Revolution</h2><p>AMD's RDNA 4 architecture, powering the RX 9070 series, is best described as an evolution of the previous RDNA 3 architecture, rather than a complete overhaul. Built on TSMC's 4nm process node, the die size of the RX 9070 and 9070 XT is similar to that of the RX 7800 XT (357 mmÂ²), but the transistor count has nearly doubled to 53.9 billion.</p><p>While the overall architectural layout appears similar to RDNA 3 at first glance, a closer look at the Compute Units (CUs) reveals key improvements and efficiencies. RDNA 4's CUs feature a dual SIMD32 architecture with enhanced matrix operations. Key features are:</p><ul><li><strong>2x 16-bit and 4x 8-bit/4-bit matrix rates.</strong></li><li><strong>4:2 structured sparsity for doubled efficiency.</strong></li><li><strong>New 8-bit float data types.</strong></li><li><strong>More efficient register management for reduced memory latency.</strong></li></ul><p>These improvements lead to enhanced performance in several areas. According to AMD, rasterization performance has improved by approximately 40% over RDNA 3. More significantly, ray tracing performance has essentially doubled, and AI performance (FP16 dense compute) has also doubled compared to the prior gen. The gains in lower-precision formats are touted as being even more substantial. This reflects the industry-wide focus on AI and machine learning, with AMD seemingly aiming to improve their standing in this area.</p><p>RDNA 4 retains the chiplet design which had been present in some prior models, which was crucial to enabling higher performance with lower power consumption.</p><h2>Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT: Specifications and Features</h2><p>The Radeon RX 9070 series initially consists of two models: the RX 9070 and the RX 9070 XT. Both cards share several core features:</p><ul><li><strong>16GB of GDDR6 memory:</strong> This provides ample VRAM for high-resolution gaming and content creation, future-proofing the cards for upcoming titles.</li><li><strong>256-bit memory interface:</strong> A wide memory bus ensures sufficient bandwidth for the GPU to access the VRAM.</li><li><strong>64MB of Infinity Cache:</strong> AMD's Infinity Cache technology helps to reduce memory latency and improve overall performance.</li><li><strong>DisplayPort 2.1a and HDMI 2.1b connectivity:</strong> Support for the latest display standards enables high refresh rates and resolutions.</li><li><strong>PCIe 5.0</strong>: Providing highest bandwidth transfer from the graphics cards to the supporting motherboard.</li><li><strong>Standard 8-pin PCIe power connectors:</strong> Unlike Nvidia's shift to the 12VHPWR connector (and subsequent issues), AMD has opted to stick with the familiar and widely compatible 8-pin connectors.</li></ul><p>The differences between the two models are summarized in the table below:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>RX 9070</th><th>RX 9070 XT</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Compute Units</td><td>56</td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td>Game Clock</td><td>2.1 GHz</td><td>2.4 GHz</td></tr><tr><td>Boost Clock</td><td>Up to 2.5 GHz</td><td>Up to 3.0 GHz</td></tr><tr><td>AI Accelerators</td><td>112</td><td>128</td></tr><tr><td>Power Target</td><td>220W</td><td>304W</td></tr><tr><td>Stream Processors</td><td>3,584</td><td>4,096</td></tr><tr><td>ROPs</td><td>128</td><td>128</td></tr><tr><td>Required System Power</td><td>650 W</td><td>750 W</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As seen from the table, the RX 9070 XT features more compute units, higher clock speeds, a larger number of AI accelerators, and, consequently, a higher power target. These specifications can have some differences with reference to the manufacturing partners of AMD, such as Gigabyte, Sapphire, ASUS and others.</p><p>It's worth noting that, unlike previous generations, there are <em>no</em> reference designs for these cards from AMD directly. All RX 9070 and 9070 XT cards will be custom designs from board partners. This means that slight variations in performance, cooling, and even power connectors can be expected between different models. Some RX 9070 XTs utilize the newer 12V-2x6 connector while the others use either dual or triple 8-pin connectors.</p><h2>Performance Expectations: Competing with the Competition</h2><p>AMD has provided some first-party benchmark results for the RX 9070 series. According to these figures the 9070 XT is averaging around 42% improvement, but independent testing confirms it will often exceed 45%. Here's a summary of AMD's claims:</p><ul><li><strong>RX 9070 XT vs. RX 7900 GRE (4K, Ultra Settings):</strong> 42% faster on average (across 30+ games, including both rasterized and ray-traced titles).</li><li><strong>RX 9070 vs. RX 7900 GRE (4K, Ultra Settings):</strong> 21% faster on average.</li><li><strong>RX 9070 XT VS RX 6900 XT (4K, Maximum Settings)</strong>: 51% Faster on average</li><li><strong>RX 9070 XT vs. RTX 3090 (4K, Max Settings):</strong> 26% faster.</li><li><strong>RX 9070 vs. RTX 3080 (4K, Max Settings):</strong> 26% faster.</li><li><strong>RX 9070 XT vs. Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti (4K):</strong> Approximately 2% slower, according to AMD's own testing.</li></ul><p>It's important to note that AMD did <em>not</em> directly compare the RX 9070 series to Nvidia's RTX 40-series or, crucially, the recently released RTX 50-series (5070, 5070 Ti, 5080, 5090) in most of their presented benchmarks. Instead, they focused on comparisons to older-generation cards, likely due to the direct pricing competition they are mounting against the RTX 5070 and 5070 Ti. While showing a substantial generational leap is valuable, gamers and consumers will naturally want to see how the new cards stack up against their direct, current-generation competition. However some early metrics compare it with strong gains versus the NVIDIA 30-series GPUs.</p><h2>Pricing and Availability: A Strong Value Proposition</h2><p>One of the most compelling aspects of the RX 9070 series is its pricing. AMD has set the MSRPs as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Radeon RX 9070:</strong> $549 USD</li><li><strong>Radeon RX 9070 XT:</strong> $599 USD</li></ul><p>These prices were officially confirmed in a special event held in China. For the Chinese market, prices are 4499 RMB for the RX 9070 and 4999 RMB for the RX 9070 XT. These are MSRP, but they may vary.</p><p>This pricing strategy directly undercuts Nvidia's offerings. For example, the RTX 5070 Ti has an official MSRP of $749, making the RX 9070 XT a significantly more affordable option, assuming AMD's performance claims hold true. This puts immense pressure on Nvidia, particularly given the ongoing supply chain issues affecting the RTX 50 series. The RTX 5070 is listed at $549 and with this price AMD will have both cards to compete in this space.</p><p>The RX 9070 series officially launched on <strong>March 6, 2025</strong>. Unlike Nvidia's staggered release strategy for the RTX 50 series, both the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT were released simultaneously. However some differences were reported regarding price accuracy from the manufacturer recommendations.</p><h2>Availability and Supply: AMD's Advantage</h2><p>While pricing is a critical factor, <em>availability</em> is equally crucial in the current GPU market. Nvidia's RTX 50-series launch has been marred by severe supply shortages, leading to inflated prices and widespread frustration among consumers. Reports suggest that these shortages could last for several months, particularly for the higher-end models (RTX 5090 and RTX 5080) but also for the RTX 5070 Ti. The issues seem to be related to the late issuance of finalized BIOSes to board partners, and manufacturing challenges. There was a production anomaly related to 0,5% of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090/5090D and 5070 Ti cards causing missing ROPs in the cards, producing around 4% lower performance in graphics (no impacts to AI and Compute loads). The impacted customers were encouraged to contact the manufacturers to request replacement.</p><p>In contrast, AMD has promised "excellent availability" for the RX 9070 series across all markets. One report even suggested that RDNA 4 shipments could be 3-10 times higher than those of the RTX 5080 at launch. The RX9070 series have better availability across the different regions, this has not been the case since pandemic years, especially in comparison with other GPU manufacturer offerings.</p><p>While the leaker indicates that there may still not be enough, due to significant pent-up consumer demand, a launch on this scale, AMD could have significant quantities that can sell out quicky due to high market interest.</p><p>AMD's strategy of shipping cards to distributors for months prior to the official launch seems to have paid off, allowing them to build up sufficient stock. Pre-orders in China have already shown exceptionally strong demand, with the RX 9070 XT significantly outpacing the non-XT model. This early indication of consumer interest, coupled with AMD's promised availability, suggests that the RX 9070 series may avoid the supply woes that have plagued Nvidia. Out of 1535 initial orders for the Chinese market the breakdown between XT and non-XT models has been reported to be close to 60/40. The 916 orders correspond to the RX 9070 XT, out of the total of 1535 entries. This advantage may allow it to capture some market, especially taking into account the ongoing issues with 50-series GPUs.</p><h2>FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) 4: AMD's Answer to DLSS</h2><p>Alongside the new hardware, AMD is also introducing FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) 4. This is AMD's next-generation upscaling and frame generation technology, designed to compete with Nvidia's Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS). FSR 4 is optimized for the new ML hardware inside the RDNA 4 graphics cards and promises to deliver significantly improved image quality compared to previous versions of FSR, which were hardware-agnostic. It features AI Upscaling.</p><p>Due to its reliance on RDNA 4's dedicated AI hardware, FSR 4 will initially be exclusive to the RX 9000 series cards at launch. AMD is aiming to have FSR 4 support in 30+ games at launch, with plans to expand to over 75 games by the end of the year.</p><h2>The Bottom Line: A Promising Launch for AMD</h2><p>The AMD Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT represent a significant step forward for AMD in the graphics card market. With competitive pricing, a focus on improved availability, and the introduction of FSR 4, AMD is positioning itself as a strong contender to Nvidia's dominance. The RDNA 4 architecture's enhancements in ray tracing and AI performance, combined with a sensible pricing strategy, make these cards attractive options for gamers and content creators alike. While independent reviews will be crucial in validating AMD's performance claims, the early signs are overwhelmingly positive. If AMD can maintain sufficient supply, the RX 9070 series has the potential to significantly disrupt the GPU landscape and offer consumers a compelling alternative to Nvidia's offerings. The market will watch the battle develop throughout the current year.</p></div><footer><p class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on March 2, 2025</p><div class="content__tags-share"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://bloglr.com/tags/game-review/">Game Review</a></li><li><a href="https://bloglr.com/tags/graphics-card-and-gpu-content/">Graphics card and GPU content</a></li></ul><aside class="content__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbloglr.com%2Famds-radeon-rx-9070-series-a-new-challenger-in-the-graphics-card-arena.html" class="js-share facebook" aria-label="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://bloglr.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbloglr.com%2Famds-radeon-rx-9070-series-a-new-challenger-in-the-graphics-card-arena.html&amp;via=bloglr&amp;text=AMD's%20Radeon%20RX%209070%20Series%3A%20A%20New%20Challenger%20in%20the%20Graphics%20Card%20Arena" class="js-share twitter" aria-label="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://bloglr.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbloglr.com%2Famds-radeon-rx-9070-series-a-new-challenger-in-the-graphics-card-arena.html&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fbloglr.com%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F41%2Famd-7900-xt-gpu-65dcacbeb5484d0cca6f6b1d.webp&amp;description=AMD's%20Radeon%20RX%209070%20Series%3A%20A%20New%20Challenger%20in%20the%20Graphics%20Card%20Arena" class="js-share pinterest" aria-label="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://bloglr.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg></a></aside></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h6 bio__name"><a href="https://bloglr.com/authors/felix/" class="invert" title="Felix">Felix</a></h3></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev"><a class="content__nav__link" href="https://bloglr.com/first-3d-printed-metal-object-made-in-space-returns-to-earth-a-giant-leap-for-space-manufacturing.html" rel="prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h6">First 3D-Printed Metal Object Made in Space Returns to Earth: A Giant Leap for Space Manufacturing</h3></a></div><div class="content__nav__next"><a class="content__nav__link" href="https://bloglr.com/galaxy-a56-vs-redmi-note-14-pro-plus-vs-poco-x7-pro-mid-range-smartphone-showdown.html" rel="prev">Next Post<h3 class="h6">Galaxy A56 vs. Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus vs. Poco X7 Pro: Mid-Range Smartphone Showdown</h3></a></div></nav></footer></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
