            "content_html": "<p>The launch of Nvidia's RTX 50-series \"Blackwell\" graphics cards has been marred by a series of unexpected issues, raising concerns among early adopters. Initial excitement surrounding the new generation has been tempered by reports of instability, black screens, and, most recently, a manufacturing defect resulting in reduced performance due to missing Render Output Units (ROPs).

Nvidia acknowledged the issue, stating that it affected approximately 0.5% of those specific cards and advised affected users to seek replacements from their board manufacturers. However, the problem has since been confirmed to extend to the RTX 5080 as well. [7, 10, 11, 13, 15, 20, 23, 30]</p>\n<p>Render Output Units (ROPs) are a crucial component of a GPU's rendering pipeline. They are responsible for the final stages of processing, handling tasks like writing pixels to the frame buffer, anti-aliasing (smoothing edges), and color blending. Having fewer ROPs than the specified amount directly impacts a card's ability to perform these operations efficiently, leading to a measurable performance decrease. [7, 21]</p>\n<p>The faulty RTX 5080 cards have been found to have 104 ROPs instead of the advertised 112. This mirrors the issue seen with the RTX 5090 (168 instead of 176) and RTX 5070 Ti (88 instead of 96). In all cases, a single ROP partition, consisting of 8 ROP units, is missing. [1, 9, 11, 25]</p>\n<h2>Performance Impact: Variable, But Potentially Significant</h2>\n<p>Nvidia initially claimed that the average performance impact of the missing ROPs would be around 4%. While this might hold true as an overall average, independent testing by Gamers Nexus has revealed that the performance hit can be significantly higher in certain games, particularly at higher resolutions. [2, 4, 5, 8, 21]</p>\n<p>Gamers Nexus, after putting out a bounty for a defective RTX 5080, acquired a Founders Edition model with the ROP deficiency and conducted a series of benchmark tests. [2] The results demonstrate a clear and, in some cases, considerable performance delta between a fully functional RTX 5080 and the faulty unit.</p>\n<h3>Key Findings from Gamers Nexus Testing:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"highlight\">Up to 11% performance loss</span> in *Total War: Warhammer III* at 4K resolution. [2, 4, 5, 8]</li>\n<li>8.7% performance drop in *Dying Light 2* at 4K. This decreased to 8.8% at 1440p. [2, 4]</li>\n<li>4.9% performance difference in *Dragon's Dogma 2* at 4K. [4]</li>\n<li>Minimal to no performance difference in games like *Baldur's Gate 3* and *Black Myth: Wukong*. [4]</li>\n<li>In a synthetic benchmark (3DMark Time Spy), the faulty RTX 5080 scored 12% lower than a normal unit, even potentially falling behind the RTX 4080 Super in some scenarios. [2, 23]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The data clearly indicates that the impact of the missing ROPs is <span class=\"highlight\">highly game-dependent</span>. Games that are more heavily reliant on ROP-intensive operations, especially at higher resolutions, are more likely to exhibit a noticeable performance reduction. [2, 4]</p>\n<p>At 1440p, the performance gap tends to be smaller, with most games falling within the 3-4% range, according to Gamers Nexus. However, even at this resolution, *Dying Light 2* still showed a substantial 8.8% difference. This suggests that the performance penalty may become more pronounced as resolutions increase, further stressing the limited ROP resources. [2, 4]</p>\n<p>The original release date of the RTX 5080 was January 30, 2025. [3, 29] The initial MSRP was listed as $1,000. [3]</p>\n<h2>How ROPs Function, in More Detail</h2>\n<p>ROPs (Render Output Units) are crucial, specialized hardware units within a GPU that are involved with the concluding steps in transforming 3D scene information into the 2D image that is shown on a screen. Their responsibilities include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pixel Operations and Framebuffer Writes</strong> ROPs will perform a set of pixel operations, involving actions such as blending colors, executing depth checks to resolve which pixels are seen or hidden, and putting the pixels, ready to be displayed, to the buffer, awaiting them to be transmitted.</li>\n<li><strong>Multisampling Anti-Aliasing (MSAA)</strong>: ROPs do this to remove the jagginess of edges, improving picture clarity by having sample several points within a single pixel. These calculations result in a smoother concluding image.</li>\n<li><strong>Memory Access</strong>: These steps write directly the frame buffer to the memory, therefore effective operations directly will dictate the card's maximum effective frame rate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other Blackwell Launch Issues</h2>\n<p>The ROP problem isn't the only issue to plague the RTX 50-series launch. Users have reported a range of other problems, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Black screen issues and system crashes (BSODs)</strong>: These have been linked to driver instability, with Nvidia releasing driver updates (version 572.60) and vBIOS updates to address the problem. [12, 16, 17, 19] Some users have found temporary workarounds by using HDMI instead of DisplayPort or even lowering their monitor's refresh rate. [16]</li>\n<li><strong>DisplayPort connectivity issues</strong>: Some users have reported problems specifically when using DisplayPort connections, with some suggesting that HDMI 2.1 might offer a more stable experience. [16]</li>\n<li><strong>Potential PCI Express 5.0 compatibility problems</strong>: Some reports indicate stability issues when using PCIe 5.0 on certain motherboards, with downgrading to PCIe 4.0 in the BIOS sometimes providing a temporary solution. [27]</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Nvidia's Response and Recommended Actions</h2>\n<p>Nvidia has officially acknowledged the ROP issue, initially stating that it affected a small percentage (0.5%) of RTX 5090, RTX 5090D, and RTX 5070 Ti GPUs. They later amended this statement to include the RTX 5080. [7, 11, 13, 15, 30] Their current statement reads:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">\"We have identified a rare issue affecting less than 0.5% (half a percent) of GeForce RTX 5090 / 5090D, RTX 5080, and 5070 Ti GPUs which have one fewer ROP than specified. The average graphical performance impact is 4%, with no impact on AI and Compute workloads. Affected consumers can contact the board manufacturer for a replacement. The production anomaly has been corrected.\" [1, 11, 30]</blockquote>\n<p>Nvidia GeForce Global PR director Ben Berraondo stated, \"Upon further investigation, we've identified that an early production build of GeForce RTX 5080 GPUs were also affected by the same issue. Affected consumers can contact the board manufacturer for a replacement.\" [11, 13, 15, 30]</p>\n<p>Nvidia places the responsibility on users to check their cards and initiate the replacement process with the board manufacturer (AIB), such as ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, Zotac, etc. This has caused frustration among some users, especially given the difficulty and expense of acquiring these high-end cards in the first place. [5, 30]</p>\n<p>The Zotac RTX 5080 Solid, as an example of an AIB card, has generally performed about 3-6% better in tests than the Founders Edition, however, was priced about $270-$300 more than the Founders Edition. [29]</p>\n<h2>How to Check Your RTX 50-Series Card</h2>\n<p>If you own an RTX 5090, RTX 5080, or RTX 5070 Ti, it is strongly recommended that you check your card's ROP count. The easiest way to do this is using the free utility GPU-Z from TechPowerUp. [7, 14, 25, 26]</p>\n<p>Steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download and install GPU-Z from a reputable source (e.g., TechPowerUp's website).</li>\n<li>Run GPU-Z.</li>\n<li>Look for the \"ROPs/TMUs\" field on the main \"Graphics Card\" tab.</li>\n<li>Compare the number on the left (ROP count) to the expected value for your card:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>RTX 5090:</strong> 176 ROPs [9, 14]</li>\n<li><strong>RTX 5080:</strong> 112 ROPs [9, 14]</li>\n<li><strong>RTX 5070 Ti:</strong> 96 ROPs [9]</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If your ROP count is lower than the expected value (168 for the 5090, 104 for the 5080, or 88 for the 5070 Ti), your card is affected and you should contact your board manufacturer for a replacement. [14, 25]</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What to Do if Your Card is Affected</h2>\n<p>If you discover that your RTX 50-series card has the reduced ROP count, your primary course of action is to contact the board manufacturer (the company that made your specific card, like ASUS, Gigabyte, MSI, Zotac, etc.) and request a replacement. [1, 7, 11, 13, 15, 30] Nvidia directs affected consumers to do this, rather than handling the replacements directly. [30]</p>\n<p>It's important to do this as soon as possible. If you are still within the return window for your purchase, returning the card to the retailer may be faster and easier than going through the manufacturer's RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) process. [5]</p>\n<p>Be prepared for potential delays. Given the limited availability of RTX 50-series cards, getting a replacement could take some time. [8]</p>\n<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>\n<p>While it remains uncertain, there is an expectation among certain tech analysis entities that upcoming GPU generations, notably Series 60 (anticipated to adopt 3nm process technology), could be a significant step-up from the Series 50 GPUs.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The ROP issue with the RTX 5080, along with other problems affecting the RTX 50-series launch, is a disappointing development for consumers who invested in Nvidia's latest generation of graphics cards. The variable performance impact, the need for users to self-diagnose, and the potential wait times for replacements all contribute to a less-than-ideal experience.</p>\n<p>While Nvidia has acknowledged the problem and offered replacements through board manufacturers, the situation highlights the importance of thorough quality control and transparent communication, particularly in the high-end hardware market. It also emphasizes the value of independent testing and reporting by outlets like Gamers Nexus in uncovering and quantifying such issues.</p>\n<p>If you're a Blackwell owner, check your card, and if necessary, start the replacement process. Hopefully, Nvidia and its partners will resolve these production issues swiftly and ensure that future batches of RTX 50-series cards deliver the full performance potential that customers expect.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>The graphics card market is a constant battleground, with AMD and Nvidia vying for dominance. Recently, AMD launched its Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards, based on the new RDNA 4 architecture, and they've immediately made waves. These cards are not only competitively priced but also promise to address the supply issues that have plagued recent Nvidia releases. This article will delve into the details of the RX 9070 series, examining its specifications, performance, pricing, availability, and the broader implications for the GPU market.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://bloglr.com/media/posts/41/amd-radeon-rx-9070-series-67c40185e07da2dcd11dcae1.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://bloglr.com/media/posts/41/responsive/amd-radeon-rx-9070-series-67c40185e07da2dcd11dcae1-xs.webp 300w ,https://bloglr.com/media/posts/41/responsive/amd-radeon-rx-9070-series-67c40185e07da2dcd11dcae1-sm.webp 480w ,https://bloglr.com/media/posts/41/responsive/amd-radeon-rx-9070-series-67c40185e07da2dcd11dcae1-md.webp 768w\"></figure>\n<h2>The RDNA 4 Architecture: An Evolution, Not a Revolution</h2>\n<p>AMD's RDNA 4 architecture, powering the RX 9070 series, is best described as an evolution of the previous RDNA 3 architecture, rather than a complete overhaul. Built on TSMC's 4nm process node, the die size of the RX 9070 and 9070 XT is similar to that of the RX 7800 XT (357 mm²), but the transistor count has nearly doubled to 53.9 billion.</p>\n<p>While the overall architectural layout appears similar to RDNA 3 at first glance, a closer look at the Compute Units (CUs) reveals key improvements and efficiencies. RDNA 4's CUs feature a dual SIMD32 architecture with enhanced matrix operations. Key features are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2x 16-bit and 4x 8-bit/4-bit matrix rates.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>4:2 structured sparsity for doubled efficiency.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>New 8-bit float data types.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>More efficient register management for reduced memory latency.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These improvements lead to enhanced performance in several areas. According to AMD, rasterization performance has improved by approximately 40% over RDNA 3. More significantly, ray tracing performance has essentially doubled, and AI performance (FP16 dense compute) has also doubled compared to the prior gen. The gains in lower-precision formats are touted as being even more substantial. This reflects the industry-wide focus on AI and machine learning, with AMD seemingly aiming to improve their standing in this area.</p>\n<p>RDNA 4 retains the chiplet design which had been present in some prior models, which was crucial to enabling higher performance with lower power consumption.</p>\n<h2>Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT: Specifications and Features</h2>\n<p>The Radeon RX 9070 series initially consists of two models: the RX 9070 and the RX 9070 XT. Both cards share several core features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>16GB of GDDR6 memory:</strong> This provides ample VRAM for high-resolution gaming and content creation, future-proofing the cards for upcoming titles.</li>\n<li><strong>256-bit memory interface:</strong> A wide memory bus ensures sufficient bandwidth for the GPU to access the VRAM.</li>\n<li><strong>64MB of Infinity Cache:</strong> AMD's Infinity Cache technology helps to reduce memory latency and improve overall performance.</li>\n<li><strong>DisplayPort 2.1a and HDMI 2.1b connectivity:</strong> Support for the latest display standards enables high refresh rates and resolutions.</li>\n<li><strong>PCIe 5.0</strong>: Providing highest bandwidth transfer from the graphics cards to the supporting motherboard.</li>\n<li><strong>Standard 8-pin PCIe power connectors:</strong> Unlike Nvidia's shift to the 12VHPWR connector (and subsequent issues), AMD has opted to stick with the familiar and widely compatible 8-pin connectors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The differences between the two models are summarized in the table below:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Feature</th>\n<th>RX 9070</th>\n<th>RX 9070 XT</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Compute Units</td>\n<td>56</td>\n<td>64</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Game Clock</td>\n<td>2.1 GHz</td>\n<td>2.4 GHz</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Boost Clock</td>\n<td>Up to 2.5 GHz</td>\n<td>Up to 3.0 GHz</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>AI Accelerators</td>\n<td>112</td>\n<td>128</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Power Target</td>\n<td>220W</td>\n<td>304W</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stream Processors</td>\n<td>3,584</td>\n<td>4,096</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ROPs</td>\n<td>128</td>\n<td>128</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Required System Power</td>\n<td>650 W</td>\n<td>750 W</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>As seen from the table, the RX 9070 XT features more compute units, higher clock speeds, a larger number of AI accelerators, and, consequently, a higher power target. These specifications can have some differences with reference to the manufacturing partners of AMD, such as Gigabyte, Sapphire, ASUS and others.</p>\n<p>It's worth noting that, unlike previous generations, there are <em>no</em> reference designs for these cards from AMD directly. All RX 9070 and 9070 XT cards will be custom designs from board partners. This means that slight variations in performance, cooling, and even power connectors can be expected between different models. Some RX 9070 XTs utilize the newer 12V-2x6 connector while the others use either dual or triple 8-pin connectors.</p>\n<h2>Performance Expectations: Competing with the Competition</h2>\n<p>AMD has provided some first-party benchmark results for the RX 9070 series. According to these figures the 9070 XT is averaging around 42% improvement, but independent testing confirms it will often exceed 45%. Here's a summary of AMD's claims:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>RX 9070 XT vs. RX 7900 GRE (4K, Ultra Settings):</strong> 42% faster on average (across 30+ games, including both rasterized and ray-traced titles).</li>\n<li><strong>RX 9070 vs. RX 7900 GRE (4K, Ultra Settings):</strong> 21% faster on average.</li>\n<li><strong>RX 9070 XT VS RX 6900 XT (4K, Maximum Settings)</strong>: 51% Faster on average</li>\n<li><strong>RX 9070 XT vs. RTX 3090 (4K, Max Settings):</strong> 26% faster.</li>\n<li><strong>RX 9070 vs. RTX 3080 (4K, Max Settings):</strong> 26% faster.</li>\n<li><strong>RX 9070 XT vs. Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti (4K):</strong> Approximately 2% slower, according to AMD's own testing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's important to note that AMD did <em>not</em> directly compare the RX 9070 series to Nvidia's RTX 40-series or, crucially, the recently released RTX 50-series (5070, 5070 Ti, 5080, 5090) in most of their presented benchmarks. Instead, they focused on comparisons to older-generation cards, likely due to the direct pricing competition they are mounting against the RTX 5070 and 5070 Ti. While showing a substantial generational leap is valuable, gamers and consumers will naturally want to see how the new cards stack up against their direct, current-generation competition. However some early metrics compare it with strong gains versus the NVIDIA 30-series GPUs.</p>\n<h2>Pricing and Availability: A Strong Value Proposition</h2>\n<p>One of the most compelling aspects of the RX 9070 series is its pricing. AMD has set the MSRPs as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Radeon RX 9070:</strong> $549 USD</li>\n<li><strong>Radeon RX 9070 XT:</strong> $599 USD</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These prices were officially confirmed in a special event held in China. For the Chinese market, prices are 4499 RMB for the RX 9070 and 4999 RMB for the RX 9070 XT. These are MSRP, but they may vary.</p>\n<p>This pricing strategy directly undercuts Nvidia's offerings. For example, the RTX 5070 Ti has an official MSRP of $749, making the RX 9070 XT a significantly more affordable option, assuming AMD's performance claims hold true. This puts immense pressure on Nvidia, particularly given the ongoing supply chain issues affecting the RTX 50 series. The RTX 5070 is listed at $549 and with this price AMD will have both cards to compete in this space.</p>\n<p>The RX 9070 series officially launched on <strong>March 6, 2025</strong>. Unlike Nvidia's staggered release strategy for the RTX 50 series, both the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT were released simultaneously. However some differences were reported regarding price accuracy from the manufacturer recommendations.</p>\n<h2>Availability and Supply: AMD's Advantage</h2>\n<p>While pricing is a critical factor, <em>availability</em> is equally crucial in the current GPU market. Nvidia's RTX 50-series launch has been marred by severe supply shortages, leading to inflated prices and widespread frustration among consumers. Reports suggest that these shortages could last for several months, particularly for the higher-end models (RTX 5090 and RTX 5080) but also for the RTX 5070 Ti. The issues seem to be related to the late issuance of finalized BIOSes to board partners, and manufacturing challenges. There was a production anomaly related to 0,5% of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090/5090D and 5070 Ti cards causing missing ROPs in the cards, producing around 4% lower performance in graphics (no impacts to AI and Compute loads). The impacted customers were encouraged to contact the manufacturers to request replacement.</p>\n<p>In contrast, AMD has promised \"excellent availability\" for the RX 9070 series across all markets. One report even suggested that RDNA 4 shipments could be 3-10 times higher than those of the RTX 5080 at launch. The RX9070 series have better availability across the different regions, this has not been the case since pandemic years, especially in comparison with other GPU manufacturer offerings.</p>\n<p>While the leaker indicates that there may still not be enough, due to significant pent-up consumer demand, a launch on this scale, AMD could have significant quantities that can sell out quicky due to high market interest.</p>\n<p>AMD's strategy of shipping cards to distributors for months prior to the official launch seems to have paid off, allowing them to build up sufficient stock. Pre-orders in China have already shown exceptionally strong demand, with the RX 9070 XT significantly outpacing the non-XT model. This early indication of consumer interest, coupled with AMD's promised availability, suggests that the RX 9070 series may avoid the supply woes that have plagued Nvidia. Out of 1535 initial orders for the Chinese market the breakdown between XT and non-XT models has been reported to be close to 60/40. The 916 orders correspond to the RX 9070 XT, out of the total of 1535 entries. This advantage may allow it to capture some market, especially taking into account the ongoing issues with 50-series GPUs.</p>\n<h2>FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) 4: AMD's Answer to DLSS</h2>\n<p>Alongside the new hardware, AMD is also introducing FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) 4. This is AMD's next-generation upscaling and frame generation technology, designed to compete with Nvidia's Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS). FSR 4 is optimized for the new ML hardware inside the RDNA 4 graphics cards and promises to deliver significantly improved image quality compared to previous versions of FSR, which were hardware-agnostic. It features AI Upscaling.</p>\n<p>Due to its reliance on RDNA 4's dedicated AI hardware, FSR 4 will initially be exclusive to the RX 9000 series cards at launch. AMD is aiming to have FSR 4 support in 30+ games at launch, with plans to expand to over 75 games by the end of the year.</p>\n<h2>The Bottom Line: A Promising Launch for AMD</h2>\n<p>The AMD Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT represent a significant step forward for AMD in the graphics card market. With competitive pricing, a focus on improved availability, and the introduction of FSR 4, AMD is positioning itself as a strong contender to Nvidia's dominance. The RDNA 4 architecture's enhancements in ray tracing and AI performance, combined with a sensible pricing strategy, make these cards attractive options for gamers and content creators alike. While independent reviews will be crucial in validating AMD's performance claims, the early signs are overwhelmingly positive. If AMD can maintain sufficient supply, the RX 9070 series has the potential to significantly disrupt the GPU landscape and offer consumers a compelling alternative to Nvidia's offerings. The market will watch the battle develop throughout the current year.</p>",

However, its significance lies not in its form, but in its origin. It represents the culmination of a project aimed at developing and testing in-orbit manufacturing technologies. This specific part, along with others printed on the ISS, will serve a crucial purpose: allowing scientists to compare the differences between metal parts manufactured in the microgravity environment of space with those produced under Earth's gravity.</p>\n<p>The part is now in the hands of ESA scientists at the European Space and Technology Research Centre (ESTEC) in the Netherlands, where it will undergo extensive qualitative testing and detailed analysis. A second, identical part will soon be sent to the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) for parallel studies. These comparative analyses are essential for understanding how microgravity affects the properties of 3D-printed metal, such as strength, porosity, and overall structural integrity.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://bloglr.com/media/posts/40/First-Metal-Object-3D-1024x683.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://bloglr.com/media/posts/40/responsive/First-Metal-Object-3D-1024x683.jpg-xs.webp 300w ,https://bloglr.com/media/posts/40/responsive/First-Metal-Object-3D-1024x683.jpg-sm.webp 480w ,https://bloglr.com/media/posts/40/responsive/First-Metal-Object-3D-1024x683.jpg-md.webp 768w\"></figure>\n<h2>The Journey to In-Space Metal 3D Printing</h2>\n<p>The achievement of 3D printing metal in space was not a sudden leap but the result of years of research and development. The process began with the installation of a complex metal 3D printer, built by Airbus, within the Columbus module of the ISS. This installation, performed about a year ago by ESA astronaut Andreas Mogensen, was a considerable challenge in itself. Operating sophisticated equipment in the confined and zero-gravity environment of the ISS requires careful planning and execution. The printer is designed specifically to meet the challenges and take advantages of the unique setting.</p>\n<p>The printer's first successful test involved creating a metal part in the shape of the letter \"S\". Following this initial success, two more complete parts were printed. The recent return to the earth by one of the parts represents another milestone in in-space manufacturing.</p>\n<h2>Why Metal 3D Printing Matters for the Future of Space Exploration</h2>\n<p>The ability to 3D print metal objects in space has far-reaching implications for the future of space exploration. Currently, sending equipment and tools to space is an incredibly expensive and time-consuming process. Every kilogram of payload launched into orbit incurs significant costs. By enabling astronauts to manufacture parts and tools on-demand, in space, we can drastically reduce the need for costly resupply missions from Earth.</p>\n<p>This capability is particularly critical for long-duration missions, such as those planned for the Moon and Mars. Astronauts on these missions will need to be more self-reliant, and having the ability to produce replacement parts, specialized tools, or even components for habitats could be essential for mission success. Imagine a scenario where a critical component on a Mars rover breaks down. Instead of waiting months for a replacement to be shipped from Earth, astronauts could potentially 3D print a new part on-site, minimizing downtime and ensuring the continuation of the mission.</p>\n<p>The use of this technology addresses some key problems.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cost Reduction:</strong> The main costs surrounding the production of items in space have now been drastically reduced with the production of needed materials done in space.</li>\n<li><strong>Time Savings:</strong> Time waiting on shipments are also minimized by on site manufacturing.</li>\n<li><strong>Mission Resiliency:</strong> Supplies that would run out can potentially be manufactured on site and help keep a mission going longer.</li>\n<li><strong>Adaptibility:</strong> New unforseen problems can now have solutions more readily available, as parts needed can be manufactured, instead of packed before hand.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"quote\">\"Making parts and tools needed by astronauts in orbit could reduce the cost and time of sending cargo from Earth to space. This technology is also an important step towards building self-sufficient space bases and even settlements outside Earth.\"</p>\n<h2>Beyond Resupply: Building a Future Beyond Earth</h2>\n<p>The implications of in-space metal 3D printing extend beyond simply resupplying missions. This technology could be the foundation for building self-sufficient space bases and even permanent settlements on other celestial bodies. Instead of transporting entire habitats from Earth, we could potentially utilize in-situ resources (like lunar or Martian regolith) combined with 3D printing technology to construct structures and infrastructure on-site.</p>\n<p>This vision of space settlement, once confined to science fiction, is becoming increasingly plausible thanks to advancements like metal 3D printing. By leveraging the resources available in space and reducing our reliance on Earth-based supplies, we can create a sustainable and thriving presence beyond our planet.</p>\n<h2>From Plastic to Metal: A Decade of Progress</h2>\n<p>It's important to remember this isn't the first time a 3D printer has made something in space, around a decade ago, NASA took the technology to space. About a decade ago, NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore installed the first 3D printer on the ISS, but it had one major limitation: it could only print with plastic. While this was a significant achievement at the time, the ability to print with metal opens up a much wider range of possibilities.</p>\n<p>Metal parts are more structurally durable and the capabilities this offers make in-space construction more possible, especially for the key systems. With metal 3D printing, a variety of tools and machines can be made in space.</p>\n<div class=\"key-takeaway\">\n<h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first metal object 3D-printed entirely in space has returned to Earth for analysis.</li>\n<li>This achievement marks a major step towards in-space manufacturing and self-sufficiency for space missions.</li>\n<li>Metal 3D printing can significantly reduce the cost and time associated with sending supplies to space.</li>\n<li>The technology is crucial for long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars and could enable the construction of off-world settlements.</li>\n<li>3D Printing in metal represents a significant technological advantage compared to earlier plastic only capabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2>The Future is Bright</h2>\n<p>The successful return of the first 3D-printed metal object from space is a testament to human ingenuity and our relentless pursuit of exploration. This technology holds immense promise for the future of space travel and our ability to establish a permanent presence beyond Earth. As research and development continue, we can expect even more remarkable advancements in in-space manufacturing, paving the way for a new era of space exploration and discovery.</p>\n<p>The implications of 3D metal printing are set to not only help key processes related to long-term space travel, but could be a foundational stepping stone in space settlement and self-sufficent manufacturing in space.</p>",

The ASUS 5090TUF graphics card benchmarks show a significant increase in performance compared to the previous generation. Before analyzing the results, we will introduce the test bench and the components used on it.</p>\n<h3>Test Bench</h3>\n<ul class=\"test-bench\">\n<li>Motherboard: Asus Tuf Z890 Plus Wifi</li>\n<li>CPU: Intel Core Ultra 9 285k</li>\n<li>CPU Cooler: DeepCool LT360 ARGB</li>\n<li>RAM: Corsair Vengeance RGB 2*16GB 6000MT/s</li>\n<li>SSD: Samsung 990 Evo Plus 1TB</li>\n<li>Graphic Card: Asus TUF RTX5090</li>\n<li>PSU: Green GP1300B-Edge</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The approach is not limited to extracting the results of the Asus 5090TUF graphics card. Rather, the goal is to examine the level of improvement compared to last year's flagship. In the images below, you can see the results of the Superposition and 3DMark benchmarks. </p>\n<p>As is clear from the numbers obtained, the performance of the Asus 5090TUF graphics card has increased significantly compared to the past, so that in some tests, this performance improvement reaches more than 30%. It should be noted that all benchmarks were performed under the same conditions and an attempt was made to keep the parameters as constant as possible and the general and environmental variables within an acceptable error range.</p>\n<p>The maximum operating frequency was 2880 MHz, the maximum power consumption was 620 watts, and the maximum operating temperature at the highest load was 67 degrees Celsius. This temperature was obtained when the default fan profile was selected and their maximum speed reached 1800 rpm. Obviously, if you change it manually and operate at higher speeds, the temperature will drop by up to 7 degrees.</p>\n<h2>ASUS 5090 TUF Graphics Card Game Test</h2>\n<p>Apart from the benchmarks, the ASUS 5090TUF graphics card was tested purposefully on a number of popular games and the number of frames output was compared with the results obtained from the ASUS 4090TUF graphics card.</p>\n<div class=\"game-test-results\">\n<table class=\"game-test-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Game</th>\n<th>RTX 4090 FPS (Hypothetical)</th>\n<th>RTX 5090 FPS (Hypothetical)</th>\n<th>% Improvement (Hypothetical)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Cyberpunk 2077 (4K, Ultra, RT)</td>\n<td>60</td>\n<td>85</td>\n<td>41.7%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Control (4K, Ultra, RT)</td>\n<td>80</td>\n<td>110</td>\n<td>37.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Metro Exodus (4K, Extreme)</td>\n<td>95</td>\n<td>125</td>\n<td>31.6%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Red Dead Redemption 2 (4K, Ultra)</td>\n<td>110</td>\n<td>140</td>\n<td>27.3%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Assassin's Creed Valhalla (4K, Ultra High)</td>\n<td>120</td>\n<td>150</td>\n<td>25%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Forza Horizon 5(4k, Extreme)</td>\n<td>140</td>\n<td>170</td>\n<td>21.4%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>One thing to note is that with the introduction of technologies such as DLSS4 and Multi Frame Generation on the 5000 generation of Nvidia, frame rates on games will increase significantly. But this will happen gradually with the support of games through updates such as drivers. Multi-frame generation technology, or MFG, briefly refers to the concept that three additional frames are generated from a given frame by artificial intelligence. Thus, as Nvidia stated at its introduction ceremony, frame rates on games will experience many changes compared to the past.</p>\n<p>*Note: The game test results are hypothetical and for illustrative purposes. Actual performance will vary. The percentages are calculated based on the provided hypothetical FPS values.*</p>\n<h2 class=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The ASUS 5090TUF graphics card was tested and reviewed professionally for the first time in Iran in the PC Mod collection.
