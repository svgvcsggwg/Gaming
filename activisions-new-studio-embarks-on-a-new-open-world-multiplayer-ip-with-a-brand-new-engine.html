The company's newly established studio, Elsewhere Entertainment, is working on a brand-new, genre-defining AAA IP that will be a narrative-driven, open-world multiplayer experience. Perhaps most strikingly, this new title will debut on a completely new game engine, a departure from Activision's long-standing reliance on the IW engine used in the <em>Call of Duty</em> series.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bloglr.com/media/posts/55/Activision-Xbox-Featured.jpg.webp" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://bloglr.com/media/posts/55/responsive/Activision-Xbox-Featured.jpg-xs.webp 300w, https://bloglr.com/media/posts/55/responsive/Activision-Xbox-Featured.jpg-sm.webp 480w, https://bloglr.com/media/posts/55/responsive/Activision-Xbox-Featured.jpg-md.webp 768w"></figure><h2>A Bold Move: Departing from the IW Engine</h2><p>For years, Activision has utilized the IW engine as the backbone of its <em>Call of Duty</em> games. This engine, originally based on id Software's id Tech 3, has undergone numerous iterations and enhancements over time, becoming synonymous with the <em>Call of Duty</em> experience. While the IW engine has proven its capabilities with impressive graphics and generally strong optimization, the decision to develop a new engine for Elsewhere Entertainment's project signifies a major strategic pivot.</p><p>Activision has stated that this new engine is being shared across the board for all *Call of Duty* developers to use in future titles.</p><h3>Why a New Engine?</h3><p>The creation of a new game engine is a resource-intensive undertaking, often involving significant time and financial investment. The decision suggests that Elsewhere Entertainment's vision for their new IP requires a technological foundation that the existing IW engine, even with modifications, cannot provide. Some specific needs that may have caused the change may include:</p><ul><li>The current IW engine may be too heavily optimized for the type of gameplay present in *Call of Duty* titles.</li><li>The new title may require support for game mechanics not present in any *Call of Duty* game.</li><li>The developers may want a clean break to establish the unique feel of the new IP.</li></ul><p>While the specifics of the new engine remain under wraps, it's clear that it represents a commitment to innovation and a willingness to push technological boundaries. It also signals Activision's ambition to expand beyond its established franchises and explore new gameplay possibilities. This new engine is not suited for use with Unreal Engine.</p><h2>Elsewhere Entertainment: A Studio Built for a New Genre</h2><p>Elsewhere Entertainment, based primarily in Warsaw, Poland, was established in 2023 with the explicit goal of creating a "genre-defining AAA franchise." The studio boasts a team comprised of industry veterans from renowned studios such as Bungie, Ubisoft, Naughty Dog, and CD Projekt RED. This diverse talent pool brings a wealth of experience in crafting narrative-driven experiences, open-world environments, and engaging multiplayer gameplay. The studio also seems to be expanding, with job listings now available in Malmo, Sweden.</p><p>The studio's focus on a "narrative-based" IP is particularly noteworthy. While <em>Call of Duty</em> games feature campaigns, the franchise is largely known for its multiplayer component. Elsewhere Entertainment's project appears to be placing a greater emphasis on storytelling and world-building, potentially drawing inspiration from the narrative-rich experiences developed by its team members' previous studios. The studio is comprised of developers who have previously worked on games like *The Last of Us*, *Uncharted*, *The Witcher*, *Cyberpunk*, *Destiny*, *The Division*, and *Far Cry*.</p><h2>Open-World Multiplayer: Blending Genres</h2><p>The combination of "open-world," "multiplayer," and "narrative-driven" suggests a unique and ambitious project. True open-world games give players a great deal of freedom to act within the game world. While some *Call of Duty* games, like *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III*, have open-world elements, they're not as prominent as the multiplayer elements of the game.</p><p>The project lead, Łukasz Nizik, Senior Expert Network Programmer, has been working with Activision on this new IP since January of 2024. Though much is still under wraps, we can glean some understanding of what direction the game will go in thanks to the combined experience of the developers. Other previous CD Projekt Red developers have confirmed that they have been working with Activision on this project as far back as 2022.</p><h2>A New Direction for Activision?</h2><p>In recent years, Activision has heavily focused on the <em>Call of Duty</em> franchise, expanding its presence in the mobile gaming market and exploring service-based models. The creation of Elsewhere Entertainment and its commitment to a new IP represents a significant departure from this strategy. It suggests a renewed interest in developing original properties and expanding Activision's portfolio beyond its established franchises.</p><p>It's important to note that Activision has ventured into new IP territory before. The company published Bungie's <em>Destiny</em> series before the two companies parted ways, and in 2019, Activision published <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>, a critically acclaimed action-adventure game developed by FromSoftware. However, Elsewhere Entertainment's project seems to be a more internally driven effort, signaling a potential long-term shift in Activision's development priorities.</p><p>Activision has recently confirmed the use of generative AI in the creation of some *Call of Duty* assets. This was confirmed by disclosures on their Steam pages in accordance with new policies established in January of 2024.</p><h2>Looking Ahead: Expectations and Speculation</h2><p>While details about Elsewhere Entertainment's project remain scarce, the available information has sparked considerable excitement and speculation within the gaming community. Some have begun to call this upcoming title a "CoD Killer". The combination of a new engine, a talented development team, and a promising genre blend has set high expectations. The timeline for the game's release is still unknown, but given the scope of the project and the new engine development, it's likely to be several years away, possibly targeting the next generation of consoles. The earliest projected release is around 2027, but some project that it will not come out until around 2030.</p><p>The gaming community will be eagerly awaiting further announcements from Activision and Elsewhere Entertainment, hoping for more concrete details about the game's setting, story, gameplay mechanics, and, of course, the capabilities of the new engine. This project has the potential to be a defining moment for Activision, demonstrating its ability to innovate and diversify beyond its established successes.</p></div><footer><p class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on March 3, 2025</p><div class="content__tags-share"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://bloglr.com/tags/game-review/">Game Review</a></li><li><a href="https://bloglr.com/tags/playstation/">PlayStation</a></li><li><a href="https://bloglr.com/tags/xbox/">Xbox</a></li></ul><aside class="content__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbloglr.com%2Factivisions-new-studio-embarks-on-a-new-open-world-multiplayer-ip-with-a-brand-new-engine.html" class="js-share facebook" aria-label="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://bloglr.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbloglr.com%2Factivisions-new-studio-embarks-on-a-new-open-world-multiplayer-ip-with-a-brand-new-engine.html&amp;via=bloglr&amp;text=Activision's%20New%20Studio%20Embarks%20on%20a%20New%20Open-World%20Multiplayer%20IP%20with%20a%20Brand%20New%20Engine" class="js-share twitter" aria-label="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://bloglr.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbloglr.com%2Factivisions-new-studio-embarks-on-a-new-open-world-multiplayer-ip-with-a-brand-new-engine.html&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fbloglr.com%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F55%2F2022-1-activision-blizzard-aquisition-microsoft-xbox-66cc7d0d2b5676090d025bcd.webp&amp;description=Activision's%20New%20Studio%20Embarks%20on%20a%20New%20Open-World%20Multiplayer%20IP%20with%20a%20Brand%20New%20Engine" class="js-share pinterest" aria-label="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://bloglr.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg></a></aside></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h6 bio__name"><a href="https://bloglr.com/authors/michael/" class="invert" title="Michael">Michael</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>The gaming world is where I can be whoever I want, live through awesome stories, and learn new stuff.
