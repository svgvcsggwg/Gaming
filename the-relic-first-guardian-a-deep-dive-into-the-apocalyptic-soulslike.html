Developed by South Korean studio Project Cloud Games and published by Perp Games, this action RPG promises a unique take on the formula, blending familiar Soulslike elements with a distinct progression system and a focus on diverse weapon-based combat. With a release window set for 2025, anticipation is building for this title, slated to arrive on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p><p> </p><div class="section"><h2>A World Shattered: The Story of Arsiltus</h2><p>The game's narrative unfolds in the ravaged realm of Arsiltus. Once a prosperous kingdom, Arsiltus has been reduced to a desolate wasteland, consumed by a catastrophic event known as "the void." This void was unleashed upon the world due to the destruction of a powerful artifact – the Great Relic. Players take on the role of the "Last Guardian," tasked with a critical mission: to locate the scattered fragments of the shattered Great Relic and, in doing so, seal the void and restore Arsiltus to its former glory.</p><p>The story promises a blend of exploration and discovery, encouraging players to piece together the events that led to Arsiltus' downfall. The "semi-open world" design suggests a degree of freedom in how players approach their objectives, allowing them to uncover secrets and side narratives along the way. The narrative, as described, focuses on the player's role as a savior, a beacon of hope in a world shrouded in darkness, fitting thematically with the Soulslike genre's often bleak and challenging settings.</p></div><div class="section"><h2>Combat: A Symphony of Weapons</h2><p><em>The Relic: First Guardian</em> places a strong emphasis on its combat system, distinguishing itself through a diverse range of weapon choices and a unique approach to character progression. The game features five distinct weapon classes, each offering a drastically different playstyle:</p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="1036" height="583" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/shQBqdSljdY" title="The Relic First Guardian Official Gameplay Trailer" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><ul><li><span class="highlight">One-Handed Weapons and Shields:</span> This classic combination provides a balanced approach, offering both solid defensive capabilities through the shield and a versatile offensive moveset with the one-handed weapon. It caters to players who prefer a mix of aggression and caution, allowing for strategic blocking and counter-attacking.</li><li><span class="highlight">Longswords:</span> These weapons boast a long reach, enabling players to engage enemies from a safer distance. While typically slower, longswords in *The Relic: First Guardian* can be empowered with special attacks, granting temporary bursts of speed and power.</li><li><span class="highlight">Daggers:</span> For players who favor agility and rapid strikes, daggers are the weapon of choice. They offer a fast-paced, stylish combat style, emphasizing quick movements and a flurry of attacks.</li><li><span class="highlight">Battle Staves:</span> These weapons incorporate gravity magic, adding a unique ranged element to combat. Although slow, landing successful hits with the battle staff reduces the cooldown of subsequent attacks, encouraging a calculated and rhythmic combat approach.</li><li><span class="highlight">Dual-Wield Weapons:</span> This option caters to players who prefer an all-out offensive style. Dual-wielding sacrifices defense for increased attack power and speed, rewarding aggressive play.</li></ul><p>Beyond the core weapon types, the game features "universal skills" that can be used regardless of the equipped weapon. This system opens up possibilities for varied skill combinations and character builds, letting players further customize their combat approach. The developers mention a parry system and dodge mechanics and stamina management, crucial for the Soulslike experience.</p></div><div class="section"><h2>A Unique Progression System: Runes, Items and Crafting</h2><p>One of the most intriguing aspects of *The Relic: First Guardian* is its departure from the traditional leveling system found in many Soulslike games. Instead of gaining experience points and allocating stats, character progression is driven by three core elements: runes, items, and crafting. There is no level grinding in this game.</p><ul><li><span class="highlight">Runes</span>: These are discoverable items that grant the character enhanced abilities and attributes. The exact nature and variety of runes remain to be fully revealed, but they promise to be a key component of character customization.</li><li><span class="highlight">Items:</span> A diverse array of items will be scattered throughout the world, each offering unique benefits or enhancements. These items could range from consumables that provide temporary buffs to equipment that alters character stats.</li><li><span class="highlight">Crafting:</span> The crafting system allows players to create new items or upgrade existing ones. The precise mechanics of crafting are yet to be detailed, but it is expected that this system will be used for upgrading the weapons.</li></ul><p>This alternative progression system aims to encourage exploration and experimentation. Instead of grinding for experience, players are incentivized to explore the world thoroughly, discover hidden items, and experiment with different combinations of runes and crafted gear. The developers are creating an "open, fantasy saga where who you become, and how you save Arsiltus, depends on how you explore and what you choose to do."</p></div><div class="section"><h2>Dungeons, Bosses, and Challenges</h2><p>As expected from a Soulslike title, <em>The Relic: First Guardian</em> will feature challenging dungeons and formidable boss encounters. These encounters are designed not only to test the player's combat skills but also to contribute to character growth, although the exact methods are still vague. Dungeons will be varied, including dense forests and ancient temples. The enemies range from "nimble dual-wielding foes to summoners".</p></div><div class="section"><h2>Development and Release</h2><p><em>The Relic: First Guardian</em> was initially announced in 2021, under the working title "Project Relic". The game is being developed by Project Cloud Games, a South Korean studio. Perp Games, known for publishing a variety of titles across different genres, is handling the publishing duties. The game is currently slated for release in 2025, specifically Q1 2025 according to some sources, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. Both physical and digital releases are planned.</p></div><div class="section"><h2>Visual Style and Art Direction</h2><p>The game features a stylized art direction. The environments are designed to be lush and detailed with atmospheric lighting. Character models appear to be designed with an attempt to convey an ancient but alive world.</p></div><div class="section"><h2>Soulslike Comparisons and Inspirations</h2><p>While <em>The Relic: First Guardian</em> embraces the Soulslike label, it's clear that the developers are aiming to carve their own niche within the genre. The absence of a traditional leveling system and the emphasis on weapon variety set it apart from some of the genre's staples, like the *Dark Souls* series, *Bloodborne*, *Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice* and *Elden Ring*. The game shares combat similarities with other games that deviate from the traditional leveling systems, such as *Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order* and *Sekiro*.</p></div><div class="section"><h2>Conclusion: A Promising New Contender</h2><p><em>The Relic: First Guardian</em> presents a compelling blend of familiar Soulslike elements and innovative ideas. Its unique progression system, diverse combat options, and intriguing narrative setup have the potential to attract both veterans of the genre and newcomers looking for a challenging but rewarding experience. As the 2025 release window approaches, more details are sure to emerge, further solidifying the game's place within the ever-evolving landscape of Soulslike action RPGs. The community's response has been generally positive, with many expressing excitement for the game's unique approach and promising combat mechanics.</p></div></div><footer><p class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on March 3, 2025</p><div class="content__tags-share"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://bloglr.com/tags/game-review/">Game Review</a></li><li><a href="https://bloglr.com/tags/playstation/">PlayStation</a></li><li><a href="https://bloglr.com/tags/xbox/">Xbox</a></li></ul><aside class="content__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbloglr.com%2Fthe-relic-first-guardian-a-deep-dive-into-the-apocalyptic-soulslike.html" class="js-share facebook" aria-label="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://bloglr.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbloglr.com%2Fthe-relic-first-guardian-a-deep-dive-into-the-apocalyptic-soulslike.html&amp;via=bloglr&amp;text=The%20Relic%3A%20First%20Guardian%20-%20A%20Deep%20Dive%20into%20the%20Apocalyptic%20Soulslike" class="js-share twitter" aria-label="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://bloglr.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbloglr.com%2Fthe-relic-first-guardian-a-deep-dive-into-the-apocalyptic-soulslike.html&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fbloglr.com%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F58%2Fthe-relic-the-first-guardian-67c54168bc1fd296e4acf79f.jpg&amp;description=The%20Relic%3A%20First%20Guardian%20-%20A%20Deep%20Dive%20into%20the%20Apocalyptic%20Soulslike" class="js-share pinterest" aria-label="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://bloglr.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg></a></aside></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h6 bio__name"><a href="https://bloglr.com/authors/robert/" class="invert" title="Robert">Robert</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>Games aren't just fun for me – they're a whole massive world of adventure, being creative, and amazing stories.
