It contains 16 percent of the world’s available fresh water.</p><p>Between 2 and 3 million years ago, the number of viral species infecting the lake’s fish increased dramatically. Now, in a new study published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, researchers have hypothesized that this viral mutation may have been linked to a distant stellar explosion.</p><blockquote><p>Apparently, cosmic rays from a supernova changed the course of viral evolution in Africa!</p><p class="author">Caitlin Nojiri, lead author of the study</p></blockquote><p>In the study, led by Caitlin Nojiri, a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, the researchers used iron isotopes to identify the 2.5 million-year-old supernova. The study was conducted in collaboration with Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor of astronomy and astrophysics, and Noemi Globus, a postdoctoral researcher.</p><p>The researchers link the stellar explosion to a sudden increase in the amount of cosmic radiation hitting Earth during the same time period. According to the researchers, the intensity of this radiation was so high that it could have damaged the DNA of living organisms, which may have caused the mutation and diversification of viral species in Lake Tanganyika. “It’s very interesting to see how events that happen at very far distances can affect our lives or the habitability of a planet,” Nojiri says.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bloglr.com/media/posts/50/2025-03-01-17_57_03-New-Study-Proposes-that-Cosmic-Radiation-Altered-Virus-Evolution-in-Africa-Uni-1024x824.jpg.webp" alt="" width="1024" height="824" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://bloglr.com/media/posts/50/responsive/2025-03-01-17_57_03-New-Study-Proposes-that-Cosmic-Radiation-Altered-Virus-Evolution-in-Africa-Uni-1024x824.jpg-xs.webp 300w, https://bloglr.com/media/posts/50/responsive/2025-03-01-17_57_03-New-Study-Proposes-that-Cosmic-Radiation-Altered-Virus-Evolution-in-Africa-Uni-1024x824.jpg-sm.webp 480w, https://bloglr.com/media/posts/50/responsive/2025-03-01-17_57_03-New-Study-Proposes-that-Cosmic-Radiation-Altered-Virus-Evolution-in-Africa-Uni-1024x824.jpg-md.webp 768w"></figure><h2>From a supernova explosion in deep space to the bed of Lake Tanganyika Lake Tanganyika</h2><p>The study began by examining the bed of Lake Tanganyika. There, they found a type of radioactive iron produced by exploding stars. By studying the decay rate of this element, known as iron-60, the researchers were able to determine its age.</p><p>The results showed that this iron formed in two different time periods: some of its atoms were created about 2.5 million years ago and others 6.5 million years ago. The researchers then traced the past paths of celestial bodies to determine the source of this iron.</p><h2>Tracing the Origin of 6.5 Million-Year-Old Iron on the Bed of Lake Tanganyika</h2><p>Our solar system is currently in a relatively empty region of matter called the “local bubble.” Earth entered this bubble about 6.5 million years ago and passed through the interstellar dust at its edge, scattering older iron-60 onto Earth.</p><p>Then, between 2 and 3 million years ago, a neighboring star exploded, delivering a second batch of radioactive iron (2.5 million years old) to Earth.</p><blockquote>“The iron-60 acts as a marker to help us date these supernovae. We believe that the supernova occurred near Earth between 2 and 3 million years ago,” Nojiri explains.</blockquote><h2>Supernova cosmic rays and genetic mutations</h2><p>When Nojiri and his colleagues simulated the supernova, they found that the cosmic rays from it hit Earth for about 100,000 years after the explosion. The model explained the sudden increase in cosmic radiation recorded on Earth during the same period, a phenomenon that had puzzled scientists for years!</p><p>According to the study, the cosmic rays from the supernova were likely so intense that they could have torn apart DNA strands.</p><blockquote>“Other studies have shown that cosmic rays can damage DNA. This could act as an accelerating factor in evolutionary changes and genetic mutations in cells,” Nojiri says.</blockquote><p>They came across this while studying viral diversity in one of the lakes in Africa’s Rift Valley, Nojiri says. “We can’t say for sure that these two phenomena are related, but the time frame is similar. The fact that the diversity of viruses increased during the same period was interesting to us.”</p><p>Although the study provides evidence for a possible link between stellar explosions, increased cosmic rays, and genetic mutations in Lake Tanganyika viruses, many questions remain. The researchers plan to better understand the role of these rays in biological change by examining more detailed geochemical data and more advanced modeling.</p><p>Future studies could also examine similar effects in other time frames and environments to further clarify the connection between cosmic events and the evolution of life.</p></div><footer><p class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on March 3, 2025</p><div class="content__tags-share"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://bloglr.com/tags/astronomy-and-space/">Astronomy and Space</a></li></ul><aside class="content__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbloglr.com%2Famazing-study-supernova-radiation-changed-the-evolution-of-viruses-in-africa.html" class="js-share facebook" aria-label="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://bloglr.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbloglr.com%2Famazing-study-supernova-radiation-changed-the-evolution-of-viruses-in-africa.html&amp;via=bloglr&amp;text=Amazing%20study%3A%20Supernova%20radiation%20changed%20the%20evolution%20of%20viruses%20in%20Africa!" class="js-share twitter" aria-label="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://bloglr.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbloglr.com%2Famazing-study-supernova-radiation-changed-the-evolution-of-viruses-in-africa.html&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fbloglr.com%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F50%2F2025-03-01-17_49_56-Cosmic-Radiation-From-A-Supernova-Altered-Virus-Evolution-In-Africa-Study-Propo-910x600.jpg.webp&amp;description=Amazing%20study%3A%20Supernova%20radiation%20changed%20the%20evolution%20of%20viruses%20in%20Africa!" class="js-share pinterest" aria-label="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://bloglr.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg></a></aside></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h6 bio__name"><a href="https://bloglr.com/authors/jessica/" class="invert" title="Jessica">Jessica</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>Gaming is way more fun when you do it with other people.
