This premium wearable builds upon the success of its predecessors, boasting significant upgrades in design, materials, health tracking features, and battery life. This article provides a comprehensive look at the Honor Watch 5 Ultra, covering its specifications, features, design, pricing, and overall value proposition.</p><p>Â </p><div class="image-container"><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bloglr.com/media/posts/39/Honor-Watch-5-ultra-unveiled-2-1024x705.jpg.webp" alt="" width="1024" height="705" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://bloglr.com/media/posts/39/responsive/Honor-Watch-5-ultra-unveiled-2-1024x705.jpg-xs.webp 300w, https://bloglr.com/media/posts/39/responsive/Honor-Watch-5-ultra-unveiled-2-1024x705.jpg-sm.webp 480w, https://bloglr.com/media/posts/39/responsive/Honor-Watch-5-ultra-unveiled-2-1024x705.jpg-md.webp 768w"></figure><br></div><h2>Design and Build Quality</h2><p>The Honor Watch 5 Ultra immediately distinguishes itself with its sophisticated and robust design. Unlike the more common rectangular design of many smartwatches, including the standard Honor Watch 5, the Ultra features a distinctive domed octagonal shape. This design choice gives it a more classic and premium aesthetic, appealing to users who prefer a traditional watch look. The case is crafted from Grade 5 titanium, known for its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio, providing both durability and a lightweight feel on the wrist. The display is protected by suspended sapphire crystal glass, offering superior scratch resistance, ensuring the watch can withstand the rigors of daily wear and tear. The use of premium materials like titanium and sapphire crystal places the Watch 5 Ultra firmly in the high-end smartwatch category.</p><p>The watch comes in two color variants: a sleek black model paired with a black fluoroelastomer strap, and a more classic brown model with a brown leather strap. The straps use a standard 22mm quick-release mechanism. This allows for easy swapping with a wide variety of third-party straps, enabling users to personalize the watch to match their style or activity. The Watch is 46mm and is not necessarily made for smaller wrists.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bloglr.com/media/posts/39/Honor-Watch-5-ultra-unveiled-3-1024x542.jpg.webp" alt="" width="1024" height="542" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://bloglr.com/media/posts/39/responsive/Honor-Watch-5-ultra-unveiled-3-1024x542.jpg-xs.webp 300w, https://bloglr.com/media/posts/39/responsive/Honor-Watch-5-ultra-unveiled-3-1024x542.jpg-sm.webp 480w, https://bloglr.com/media/posts/39/responsive/Honor-Watch-5-ultra-unveiled-3-1024x542.jpg-md.webp 768w"></figure><p>The watch has achieved both 5ATM and IP68 ratings. The 5ATM rating signifies that the watch is water-resistant up to 50 meters, making it suitable for swimming and other water-based activities. The IP68 rating ensures that the watch is dust-tight and can withstand immersion in water beyond 1 meter for a specified duration. Adding to the diving capabilites, Honor included a dedicated Free Diving Mode. This mode allows the Watch 5 Ultra to delve up to 40m (130ft) underwater.</p><p>On the right side of the case, the Honor Watch 5 Ultra features two physical controls. A rotating crown, accented with a stylish red stripe, allows for smooth and intuitive navigation through the watch's interface, complete with haptic feedback. Below the crown sits a customizable button, which by default launches the activity tracking app but can be reprogrammed to trigger other functions based on user preference.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bloglr.com/media/posts/39/Honor-Watch-5-ultra-unveiled-4-1024x571.jpg.webp" alt="" width="1024" height="571" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://bloglr.com/media/posts/39/responsive/Honor-Watch-5-ultra-unveiled-4-1024x571.jpg-xs.webp 300w, https://bloglr.com/media/posts/39/responsive/Honor-Watch-5-ultra-unveiled-4-1024x571.jpg-sm.webp 480w, https://bloglr.com/media/posts/39/responsive/Honor-Watch-5-ultra-unveiled-4-1024x571.jpg-md.webp 768w"></figure><h2>Display</h2><p>The centerpiece of the Honor Watch 5 Ultra is its vibrant 1.5-inch AMOLED display. AMOLED technology delivers deep blacks, excellent contrast, and vivid colors, making the display visually appealing and easy to read in various lighting conditions. The screen boasts a resolution of 466 x 466 pixels, resulting in a sharp pixel density of approximately 310 ppi (pixels per inch). This ensures that text and graphics appear crisp and detailed. The screen-to-body ratio is an impressive 82.6%, maximizing the display area within the watch's form factor. The Always on Display feature gives an opportunity to always have access to the information, even when the watch is not in active use.</p><p>The display supports a refresh rate of up to 60 Hz, thanks to LTPO (Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Oxide) technology. A higher refresh rate contributes to smoother scrolling and animations, enhancing the overall user experience. The LTPO technology allows the display to dynamically adjust its refresh rate based on the content being displayed, optimizing power consumption and extending battery life.</p><h2>Software and Features</h2><p>The Honor Watch 5 Ultra runs on MagicOS 7.2, Honor's proprietary operating system. While MagicOS provides a smooth and user-friendly experience, it's important to note that it differs significantly from platforms like Wear OS (used by Google and Samsung) or watchOS (used by Apple). One key difference is the absence of a third-party app store. This limits the user to the pre-installed apps provided by Honor, unlike Wear OS or watchOS devices which boast vast app ecosystems.</p><p>However, Magic OS on the Honor Watch 5 Ultra offers various built-in features including:</p><ul><li>Music Playback</li><li>Weather updates</li><li>Alarms</li><li>Notifications of Apps</li></ul><p>Additionally the watch can allow users to load songs, and play them on Bluetooth headphones, all while leaving your phone behind. Although, there are only 8 GB of storage available.</p><h2>Health and Fitness Tracking</h2><p>The Honor Watch 5 Ultra is packed with a comprehensive suite of health and fitness tracking capabilities. It goes beyond basic step counting and provides in-depth monitoring of various physiological parameters. Key features include:</p><ul><li><strong>Quick Health Scan:</strong> This feature allows users to obtain a quick and comprehensive overview of their health metrics, including an electrocardiogram (ECG) reading. The ECG functionality enables the detection of irregular heart rhythms, which can be an indicator of potential health issues.</li><li><strong>Heart Rate Monitoring:</strong> The watch continuously monitors heart rate throughout the day and night, providing valuable data for assessing cardiovascular health and fitness levels.</li><li><strong>Blood Oxygen (SpO2) Measurement:</strong> The SpO2 sensor measures the oxygen saturation levels in the blood, which can be an important indicator of respiratory health and overall well-being.</li><li><strong>Sleep Tracking:</strong> The watch offers detailed sleep tracking, analyzing sleep stages (light, deep, REM) and providing insights into sleep quality.</li><li><strong>Sports Modes:</strong> The Honor Watch 5 Ultra supports over 100 sports modes, covering a wide range of activities from running and cycling to swimming and more specialized workouts. The watch automatically detects many physical activities, simplifying the tracking process.</li><li><strong>Health Monitor Report:</strong> This feature compiles all the health data collected from the previous day, presenting the user with a consolidated report on their overall health status.</li><li><strong>All-Day Health Tracking</strong>: Provides a continuous record of your well-being.</li></ul><h2>Battery Life</h2><p>One of the most impressive aspects of the Honor Watch 5 Ultra is its exceptional battery life. The watch is equipped with a 480 mAh battery, which Honor claims can provide up to 15 days of typical usage on a single charge. This significantly outperforms many other smartwatches on the market, including some of the leading models from competitors. The actual battery life will depend on individual usage patterns, including the frequency of GPS use, screen brightness settings, and the number of active health tracking features.</p><p>The Honor Watch 5 Ultra supports both wireless charging and reverse wireless charging. Wireless charging allows for convenient cable-free charging using a compatible charging pad. Reverse wireless charging enables the watch to be charged by placing it on the back of a compatible smartphone or other device that supports this feature, providing added flexibility in charging options.</p><h2>Connectivity</h2><p>While detailed connectivity specifications are limited, the Honor Watch 5 Ultra does support Bluetooth 5.2. This latest Bluetooth version allows for faster data and low energy. There is built in GPS, meaning users are able to track workouts without a phone nearby.</p><h2>Pricing and Availability</h2><p>The Honor Watch 5 Ultra is priced at 279 euros (approximately $280 USD or Â£231, as of March 2, 2025. Honor Watch is compatible with Android 9.0 and iOS 13.0 and higher.</p><h2>Specifications Table</h2><table class="specs-table"><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Specification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Display</td><td>1.5-inch LTPO AMOLED, 466 x 466 pixels (310 ppi), up to 60Hz refresh rate</td></tr><tr><td>Case Material</td><td>Grade 5 Titanium</td></tr><tr><td>Glass</td><td>Sapphire Crystal</td></tr><tr><td>Dimensions</td><td>46.3 mm diameter, 11.4 mm thickness</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>51.8g (without strap)</td></tr><tr><td>Battery</td><td>480 mAh, up to 15 days typical usage</td></tr><tr><td>Charging</td><td>Wireless charging, Reverse wireless charging</td></tr><tr><td>Water Resistance</td><td>5ATM, IP68</td></tr><tr><td>Dive Depth</td><td>Up to 40m (130ft) with Free Diving Mode</td></tr><tr><td>Operating System</td><td>MagicOS 7.2</td></tr><tr><td>Sensors</td><td>Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Heart Rate Sensor, SpO2 Sensor, ECG Sensor</td></tr><tr><td>Connectivity</td><td>Bluetooth 5.2, GPS</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>8GB</td></tr><tr><td>Sports Modes</td><td>100+</td></tr><tr><td>Compatibility</td><td>Android 9.0 and iOS 13.0 and higher</td></tr><tr><td>Other Features</td><td>Over 10,000 watch faces, 24-hour health tracking, dedicated diving mode, Quick Health Scan, Health Monitor Report</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="pros-cons-list"><div class="pros"><h3>Pros:</h3><ul><li>Premium and Durable Design</li><li>Stunning AMOLED Display</li><li>Exceptional Battery Life</li><li>Comprehensive Health Tracking Features including ECG</li><li>Extensive Sport Modes Support</li><li>Waterproof with advanced diving modes</li><li>Customizable Button</li></ul></div><div class="cons"><h3>Cons:</h3><ul><li>Lack of a third-party app ecosystem</li><li>Potentially large size may not be ideal for smaller wrists</li><li>Proprietary operating system may lack some advanced smartwatch features</li><li>Limited information on availability</li></ul></div></div><h2>Conclusion</h2><p class="conclusion">The Honor Watch 5 Ultra is a compelling offering in the premium smartwatch market.
